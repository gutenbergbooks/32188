<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">1. <i>Upon His Majesties calling this last Parliament.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>His</b> last Parliament I called, not more
by others advice, and necessity of My
affairs, then by my own choice and inclination;
who have always thought
the right way of Parliaments most safe for My
Crown, and best pleasing to my People: And
although I was not forgetfull of those sparks,
which some mens distempers formerly studied
to kindle in Parliaments, (which by forbearing
to convene for some years, I hoped to have
extinguished) yet resolving with My self to
give all just satisfaction to modest and sober
desires, and to redress all publick grievances in
Church and State; I hoped (by My freedom
and their moderation) to prevent all mis-understandings
and miscarriages in this: In which
as I feared, affairs would meet with some passion
and prejudice in other men, so I resolved
they should finde least of them in my self; not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[page 2]</span>
doubting, but by the weight of Reason I
should counterpoiz the over-ballancing of any
Factions.</p>

<p>I was, indeed, sorry to hear with what partiality
and popular heat, Elections were carried
in many places; yet hoping that the gravity
and discretion of other Gentlemen would allay
and fix the Commons to a due temperament
(guiding some mens well-meaning zeal
by such rules of moderation as are best both
to preserve and restore the health of all States
and Kingdoms:) No man was better pleased
with the convening of this Parliament then
My self; who knowing best the largenesse of
my own Heart toward my Peoples good and
just contentment, pleased my self most in that
good and firm understanding, which would
hence grow between me and my people.</p>

<p>All jealousies being laid aside, my own and
my Childrens Interests gave me many obligations
to seek and preserve the love and welfare
of my Subjects; The only temporal blessing
that is left to the ambition of just Monarchs,
as their greatest honour and safety,
next Gods protection. I cared not to lessen
my self in some things of my wonted Prerogative;
since I knew I could be no loser, if I
might gain but a recompence in my Subjects
affections.</p>

<p>I intended not only to oblige my friends, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[page 3]</span>
mine enemies also: exceeding even the desires
of those that were factiously discontented, if
they did but pretend to any modest and sober
sense.</p>

<p>The <i><b>odium</b></i> and offences which some mens
rigor or remissnesse in Church and State had
contracted upon my Government, I resolved
to have expiated by such Laws and regulations
for the future, as might not only rectifie
what was amiss in practice, but supply what
was defective in the constitution: No man
having a greater zeal to see Religion setled,
and preserved in Truth, Unitie, and Order
then my self; whom it most concerns both in
pietie and policie; as knowing, that, No
flames of civil dissentions are more dangerous
then those which make Religious pretensions
the grounds of Factions.</p>

<p>I resolved to reform, what I should by free
and full advice in Parliament be convinced to
be amiss; and to grant whatever my Reason
and Conscience told me was fit to be
desired; I wish I had kept my self within
those bounds, and not suffered my own
Judgement to have been over-born in some
things, more by others Importunities, then
their Arguments; my confidence had less betrayed
my self, and my Kingdoms, to those advantages,
which some men sought for, who
wanted nothing but power and occasion to do
mischief.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[page 4]</span>

<p>But our sins being ripe, there was no
preventing of Gods Justice, from reaping that
glory in our Calamities, which we robbed
him of in our prosperitie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>For thou (O Lord) hast made us see, That
Resolutions of future Reforming, doe not alwayes
satisfie thy justice, nor prevent thy Vengeance
for former miscarriages.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Our sins have over-laid our hopes: Thou
hast taught us to depend on thy mercies to forgive,
not on our purpose to amend.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>When thou hast vindicated thy glory by
thy judgments, and hast shewed us how unsafe
it is to offend thee, upon presumptions afterwards
to please thee, Then I trust thy mercy
will restore those blessings to us, which we have
so much abused, as to force thee to deprive us
of them.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>For want of timely repentance of our sins,
Thou givest us cause to Repent of those Remedies
we too late apply.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Yet I doe not repent of my calling the last
Parliament, because O Lord, I did it with an
upright intention to thy glory, and My Peoples
good.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>The miseries which have ensued upon me and
my Kingdoms, are the just effects of thy displeasure
upon us; and may be yet, through thy mercy,
preparatives of us to future blessings and better
hearts to enjoy them.</i></b></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[page 5]</span>

<p><b><i>O Lord, though thou hast deprived us of
many former comforts; yet grant me and my
People the benefit of our afflictions, and thy
chastisements; that thy Rod as well as thy Staff
may comfort us: Then shall we dare to account
them the strokes not of an enemy, but a Father:
when thou givest us those humble affections,
that measure of patience in repentance which
becomes thy Children; I shall have no cause to
repent the miseries this Parliament hath occasioned,
when by them thou hast brought me and
my people unfeignedly to repent of the sins we
have committed.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Thy grace is infinitely better with our sufferings,
then our Peace could be with our sins.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>O thou soveraign goodness and wisdom, who
over-rulest all our Counsels; over-rule also all
our hearts; That the worse things we suffer by
thy Justice, the better we may be by thy mercie.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>As our sins have turned our Antidotes into
Poison, so let thy Grace turn our Poison into
Antidotes.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>As the sins of our Peace disposed us to this
unhappy Warre, so let this War prepare us for
thy blessed Peace.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>That although I have but troublesom Kingdoms
here, yet I may attain to that Kingdom
of Peace in my Heart, and in thy Heaven,
which Christ hath purchased, &amp; thou wilt give
to thy servant (though a sinner) for my Saviours
sake.</i> Amen.</b></p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">2. <i>Upon the Earl of Straffords death</i>.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">I</span>
<b>Looked</b> upon my Lord of <i><b>Strafford</b></i>, as a
Gentleman, whose great abilities might
make a Prince rather afraid, then ashamed to
employ him in the greatest affairs of State.</p>

<p>For those were prone to create in him great
confidence of undertakings, and this was
like enough to betray him to great errors,
and many enemies; whereof he could not but
contract good store, while moving in so high
a sphear, and with so vigorous a lustre, he must
needs (as the Sun) raise many envious exhalations,
which condensed by a popular <i><b>odium</b></i>,
were capable to cast a cloud before the brightest
merit and integrity.</p>

<p>Though I cannot in my judgement approve
all he did, driven (it may be) by the necessities
of times, and the Temper of that people,
more then led by his own disposition to any
height and rigour of actions: yet I could never
be convinced of any such criminousness in him
as willingly to expose his life to the stroke of
Justice, and malice of his enemies. I never
met with a more unhappy conjuncture of affairs,
then in the businesse of that unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[page 7]</span>
Earl: when between my own unsatisfiedness
in Conscience, and a necessity (as some told
me) of satisfying the importunities of some
people, I was perswaded by those that I
think wished Me well, to chuse rather what
was safe, then what seemed just; preferring
the outward peace of My Kingdoms with
men, before that inward exactness of Conscience
before God.</p>

<p>And indeed I am so far from excusing or denying
that compliance on My part (for plenary
consent it was not) to his destruction, whom in
My judgment I thought not, by any clear law,
guilty of death: That I never bare any touch
of Conscience with greater regret: which as a
sign of my repentance, I have often with sorrow
confessed both to God and men, as an act
of so sinfull frailty, that it discovered more a
fear of man, then of God, whose name and
place on earth no man is worthy to bear, who
will avoid inconveniencies of State, by acts of
so high injustice, as no publick convenience can
expiate or compensate.</p>

<p>I see it a bad exchange to wound a mans own
Conscience, thereby to salve State-sores; to
calm the storms of popular discontents, by stirring
up a tempest in a mans own bosome.</p>

<p>Nor hath Gods Justice failed in the event
and sad consequences, to shew the world the
fallacy of that Maxime, <b><i>Better one man perish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[page 8]</span>
(though unjustly) then the people be displeased
or destroyed.</i></b></p>

<p> For, In all likelihood I could never have suffered,
with My people, greater calamities, (yet with
greater comfort) had I vindicated <b><i><b>Straffords</b></i></b>
innocency, at least by denying to Sign that destructive
<b><i>Bill</i></b>, according to that Justice, which
My conscience suggested to Me, then I have
done since I gratified some mens unthankful
importunities with so cruel a favour. And I
have observed, that those, who counselled Me
to sign that Bill, have been so far from receiving
the rewards of such ingratiatings with
the People, that no men have been harassed &amp;
crushed more then they: He onely hath been
least vexed by them, who counselled Me, not
to consent against the vote of My own Conscience:
I hope God hath forgiven Me and them,
the sinful rashness of that business.</p>

<p>To which being in My soul so fully conscious,
those Judgements God hath pleased to
send upon Me, are so much the more welcom,
as a means (I hope) which his mercy hath sanctified
so to Me, as to make Me repent of that
unjust Act, (for so it was to Me) and for the
future to teach Me, That the best rule of policie
is, to prefer the doing of Justice, before
all enjoyments, and the peace of my Conscience
before the preservation of My Kingdoms.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[page 9]</span>

<p>Nor hath any thing more fortified My resolutions
against all those violent importunities,
which since have sought to gain a like consent
from Me, to Acts, wherein my Conscience is
unsatisfied, then the sharp touches I have had
for what passed Me, in My Lord of <i><b>Straffords</b></i>
business.</p>

<p>Not that I resolved to have imployed him in
My affairs, against the advise of my Parliament,
but I would not have had any hand in his
Death, of whose Guiltlesness I was better assured,
then any man living could be.</p>

<p>Nor were the crimes objected against him
so clear, as after a long and fair hearing to
give convincing satisfaction to the Major part
of both Houses; especially that of the Lords,
of whom scarce a third part were present,
when the bill passed that House: And for the
House of Commons, many Gentlemen, disposed
enough to diminish My Lord of <i><b>Straffords</b></i>
greatness and power, yet unsatisfied of
his guilt in Law, durst not condemn him to
die: who for their integrity in their Votes,
were by Posting their Names, exposed to the
popular calumny, hatred and fury; which grew
then so exorbitant in their clamours <i><b>for Justice</b></i>,
(that is, to have both my self and the two
Houses' Vote, and doe as they would have us)
that many ('tis thought) were rather terrified
to concur with the condemning party, then satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[page 10]</span>
that of right they ought so to doe.</p>

<p>And that after-Act vacating the Authority
of the precedent, for future imitation sufficiently
tels the world, that some remorse touched
even his most implacable enimies, as knowing
he had very hard measure, and such as they
would be very loath should be repeated to
themselves.</p>

<p>This tendernesse and regret I find in my
soul, for having any hand (and that very unwillingly
God knows) in shedding one mans
bloud unjustly, (though under the colour and
formalities of Justice, and pretences of avoiding
publick mischiefs) which may (I hope) be
some evidence before God and man, to all
posterity, that I am far from bearing justly
the vast load and guilt of all that blood which
hath been shed in this unhappy War; which
some men will needs charge on me, to ease
their own souls, who am, and ever shall be,
more affraid to take away any mans life unjustly
then to lose my own.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">M</span>
<b>Y</b> going to the House of Commons to
demand Justice upon the five Members,
was an act which my Enemies loaded with all
the obloquies and exasperations they could.</p>

<p>It filled indifferent men with great jealousies
and fears; yea, and many of my Friends
resented it, as a motion rising rather from Passion
then Reason, and not guided with such
discretion as the touchiness of those times required.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[page 13]</span>

<p>But these men knew not the just motives,
and pregnant grounds, with which I thought
myself so furnished, that there needed nothing
to such evidence, as I could have produced
against those I charged, save onely a free
and legall Trial, which was all I desired.</p>

<p>Nor had I any temptation of displeasure or
revenge against those mens persons, further
then I had discovered those (as I thought) unlawfull
correspondencies they had used, and
engagements they had made to embroyl my
Kingdoms: of all which I missed but little to
have produced Writings under some mens
own hands, who were the chief contrivers of
the following Innovations.</p>

<p>Providence would not have it so; yet I wanted
not such probabilities as were sufficient to
raise jealousies in any Kings heart, who is not
wholly stupid and neglective of the publick
Peace; which to preserve, my calling in question
half a dozen men, in a fair and legall way
(which God knows, was all my design) could
have amounted to no worse effect, had it succeeded,
then either to do Me and my Kingdom
right, in case they had been found guilty; or
else to have cleared their innocency, and removed
my suspicion: which, as they were not
raised out of any malice, so neither were they
in reason to be smothered.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[page 14]</span>

<p>What flames of discontent this spark (though
I sought by all speedy and possible means to
quench it) soon kindled, all the world is witnesse:
The aspersion which some men cast upon
that action, as if I had designed by force to
assault the House of Commons, and invade
their Priviledge, is so false, that, as God best
knows, I had no such intent; so none that attended
Me could justly gather from any thing
I then said or did, the least intimation of any
such thoughts.</p>

<p>That I went attended with some Gentlemen,
as it was no unwonted thing for the Majesty
and safety of a King so to be attended, especially
in discontented times; so were my
Followers at that time short of my ordinary
Guard, and no way proportionable to hazard
a tumultuary conflict. Nor were they more scared
at my coming, then I was unassured of not
having some affronts cast upon me, if I had
none to be with Me to preserve a reverence to
Me: for many people had (at that time) learned
to think those hard thoughts, which they
have since abundantly vented against Me, both
by words and deeds.</p>

<p class="ind">The sum of that businesse was this,</p>

<p>Those men and their adherents were then
look'd upon by the affrighted vulgar, as greater
Protectors of their Laws and Liberties then my
Self, and so worthier of their protection. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[page 15]</span>
leave them to God and their own Consciences,
who, if guilty of evill machinations, no present
impunity, or popular vindications of
them will be subterfuge sufficient to rescue
them from those exact Tribunals.</p>

<p>To which, in the obstructions of Justice among
men, we must religiously appeal, as being
an argument to us Christians of that after
unavoidable Judgement, which shall re-judge
what among men is but corruptly decided, or
not at all.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to have prevented, if God had
seen fit, those future commotions which I foresaw,
would in all likelyhood follow some
mens activity (if not restrained) and so now
hath done to the undoing of many thousands;
the more is the pity.</p>

<p>But to over-awe the freedom of the Houses,
or to weaken their just Authority by any violent
impressions upon them, was not at all my
design: I thought I had so much Justice and
Reason on my side, as should not have needed
so rough assistance: and I was resolved rather
to bear the repulse with patience, then to use
such hazardous extremities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>But thou, O Lord art my witnesse in heaven,

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">4. <i>Upon the Insolency of the Tumults.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">I</span>
<b>Never</b> thought any thing (except our sins)
more ominously presaging all these mischiefs,
which have followed, then those Tumults
in <i><b>London</b></i> and <i><b>Westminster</b></i>, soon after
the convening of this Parliament; which
were not like a storm at Sea, (which yet wants
not its terrour) but like an Earth-quake, shaking
the very foundations of all; then which
nothing in the world hath more of horror.</p>

<p>As it is one of the most convincing Arguments
that there is a God, while his power sets
bounds to the raging of the Sea: so 'tis no less,
that he restrains the madness of the People.
Nor doth any thing portend more Gods displeasure
against a Nation, then when he suffers
the confluence and clamours of the Vulgar to
passe all boundaries of Laws and reverence to
Authority.</p>

<p>Which those Tumults did to so high degrees
of Insolence, that they spared not to invade the
Honour and Freedom of the two Houses, menacing,
reproaching, shaking, yea, and assaulting some
Members of both Houses, as they
fancied, or disliked them: Nor did they forbear
most rude and unseemly deportments,
both in contemptuous words and actions, to
my Self and my Court.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[page 18]</span>

<p>Nor was this a short fit or two of shaking,
as an ague, but a quotidian fever, always encreasing
to higher inflammations, impatient of
any mitigation, restraint, or remission.</p>

<p>First, They must be a guard against those
fears which some men scared themselves and
others withall; when indeed nothing was
more to be feared, and lesse to be used by wise
men, then those tumultuary confluxes of mean
and rude people, who are taught first to petition,
then to protect, then to dictate, at last to
command and over-aw the Parliament.</p>

<p>All obstructions in Parliament (that is, all
freedom of differing in Votes, and debating
matters with reason and candor) must be taken
away with these Tumults; By these must the
Houses be purged, and all rotten Members (as
they pleased to count them) cast out: By
these the obstinacie of men resolved to discharge
their Consciences, must be subdued;
by these all factious, seditious, and schismaticall
Proposals against Government Ecclesiastical
or Civil, must be backed and abetted, till
they prevailed.</p>

<p>Generally, who-ever had most mind to bring
forth confusion and ruine upon Church and
State, used the midwifery of those Tumults:
whose riot and impatience was such, that they
would not stay the ripening and season of
Counsels, or fair production of Acts, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[page 19]</span>
order, gravity, and deliberatenesse befitting a
Parliament; but ripped up with barbarous
cruelty, and forcibly cut out abortive Votes,
such as their Inviters and Encouragers most
fancied.</p>

<p>Yea, so enormous and detestable were their
outrages, that no sober man could be without
an infinite shame and sorrow to see them so tolerated
and connived at by some; countenanced,
encouraged, and applauded by others.</p>

<p>What good man had not rather want any
thing he most desired, for the publick good,
then obtain it by such unlawfull and irreligious
means? But mens passions and Gods directions
seldom agree; violent designes and
motions must have sutable engines: such as too
much attend their own ends, seldom confine
themselves to Gods means. Force must crowd
in what Reason will not lead.</p>

<p>Who were the chief Demagogues and Patrons
of Tumults, to send for them, to flatter
and embolden them, to direct and tune
their clamorous importunities, some men yet
living are too conscious to pretend ignorance:
God in his due time will let these see, That
those were no fit means to be used for attaining
his ends.</p>

<p>But as it is no strange thing for the Sea to
rage, when strong winds blow upon it; so neither
for Multitudes to become insolent, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[page 20]</span>
they have Men of some reputation for parts
and piety to set them on.</p>

<p>That which made their rudenesse most formidable,
was, that many Complaints being
made, and Messages sent by my Self, and,
some of both Houses; yet no Order for redress
could be obtained with any vigour and
efficacie, proportionable to the malignity of
that now far-spread disease, and predominant
mischief.</p>

<p>Such was some mens stupidity, that they feared
no inconvenience; Others petulancie, that
they joyed to see their betters shamefully outraged
and abused, while they knew their onely
security consisted in vulgar flattery: so insensible
were they of Mine, or the two Houses
common Safety and Honours.</p>

<p>Nor could ever any Order be obtained, impartially
to examine, censure, and punish the
known Boutefeus, and impudent Incendiaries,
who boasted of the influence they had and
used, to convoke those Tumults as their advantages
served.</p>

<p>Yea, some (who should have been wiser
States-men) owned them as friends, commending
their Courage, Zeal, and Industry; which
to sober men could seem no better then that
of the Divel, who <i><b>goes about seeking whom he
may</b></i> deceive and <i><b>devour.</b></i></p>

<p>I confesse, when I found such a deafness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[page 21]</span>
that no Declaration from the Bishops, who
were first fouly insolenced and assaulted; nor
yet from other Lords and Gentlemen of Honor;
nor yet from my self could take place
for the due repression of these Tumults; and
securing not only Our freedom in Parliament,
but Our very persons in the Streets; I thought
My self not bound by my presence to provoke
them to higher boldness and contempts; I
hoped by my with-drawing to give time, both
for the ebbing of their tumultuous furie, and
others regaining some degrees of modesty and
sober sense.</p>

<p>Some may interpret it as an effect of Pusillanimitie
in any man for popular terrors to desert
his publick station. But I think it a hardiness,
beyond true valor, for a wise man to set himself
against the breaking in of a Sea; which to resist,
at present, threatens imminent danger;
but to withdraw, gives it space to spend its fury,
and gains a fitter time to repair the breach.
Certainly a gallant man had rather fight to
great disadvantages for number and place in
the field, in an orderly way, then skuffle with
an undisciplined rabble.</p>

<p>Some suspected and affirmed that I meditated
a war (when I went from <i><b>Whitehal</b></i> only to redeem
my Person &amp; Conscience from violence)
God knows I did not think of a war. Nor will
any prudent man conceive that I would by so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[page 22]</span>
many former and some after-acts, have so
much weakned My self, if I had purposed to
engage in a war, which to decline by all means,
I denyed my self in so many particulars: 'Tis
evident I had then no Army to fly unto, for
protection or vindication.</p>

<p>Who can blame me, or any other for a withdrawing
our selves from the daily baitings of
the Tumults, not knowing whether their fury
and discontent might not fly so high, as to
worry and tear those in pieces, whom as yet
they but played with in their paws? God, who
is my sole Judg, is my Witness in Heaven, that
I never had any thoughts of going from My
house at <i><b>Whitehall</b></i>, if I could have had but any
reasonable fair Quarter; I was resolved to bear
much, and did so, but I did not think my self
bound to prostitute the Majesty of my place
and Person, the safety of my Wife and children,
to those who are prone to insult most, when
they have objects and opportunity, most capable
of their rudeness and petulancy.</p>

<p>But this business of the Tumults (whereof
some have given already an account to God,
others yet living, know themselves desperatly
guilty) time and the guilt of many hath so smothered
up and buried, that I think it best to
leave it as it is: Only I beleeve the just Avenger
of all disorders, will in time make those men,
and that City, see their sin in the glass of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[page 23]</span>
Punishment. 'Tis more then an even lay, they
may one day see themselves punished by that
way they offended.</p>

<p>Had this Parliament, as it was in its first Election
and Constitution, sate full and free, the
Members of both Houses being left to their
freedom of Voting, as in all reason, honor, and
Religion, they should have been; I doubt
not but things would have been so carried,
as would have given no less content to all
good men, then they wished or expected.</p>

<p>For, I was resolved to hear reason in all
things, and to consent to it so far as I could
comprehend it: but as Swine are to Gardens
and orderly Plantations, so are Tumults to
Parliaments, and Plebeian concourses to publick
Councels, turning all into disorders and
sordid confusions.</p>

<p>I am prone sometimes to think, That had I
called this Parliament to any other place in
<i><b>England</b></i>, (as I might opportunely enough have
done) the sad consequences, in all likelihood,
with Gods blessing, might have been prevented.
A Parliament would have been welcom
in any place; no place afforded such confluence
of various and vitious humors, as that where
it was unhappily convened. But we must
leave all to God, who orders our disorders,
and magnifies his wisdom most, when our
follies and miseries are most discovered.</p>

Kingdoms) I willingly passed the <span class="sc">Bill</span> for
Trienniall Parliaments: which, as gentle and
seasonable Physick, might (if well applied)
prevent any distempers from getting any head,
or prevailing; especially, if the remedy proved
not a remedy beyond all remedy.</p>

<p>I conceived, this Parliament would finde
work with convenient Recesses for the first
three years: But I did not imagine, that some
men would thereby have occasioned more
work then they found to do, by undoing so
much as they found well done to their hands.
Such is some mens activity, that they will needs
make work rather then want it; and chuse to
be doing amiss, rather then do nothing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[page 27]</span>

<p>When that first Act seemed too scanty to
satisfie some mens fears, and compass publick
Affairs; I was perswaded to grant that
<span class="sc">Bill</span> of sitting during the pleasure of the
Houses; which amounted, in some mens sense,
to as much as the perpetuating of this Parliament.
By this Act of highest confidence, I hoped
for ever to shut out, and lock the door upon
all present jealousies, and future mistakes:
I confess, I did not thereby intend to shut my
Self out of doors, as some men have now requited
me.</p>

<p>True, it was an Act unparallell'd by any of
my Predecessors; yet cannot in reason admit
of any worse interpretation then this, of an
extreme confidence I had, That my Subjects
would not make ill use of an Act, by which I
declared so much to trust them, as to deny my
Self in so high a point of my Prerogative.</p>

<p>For good Subjects will never think it just or
fit, that my Condition should be worse, by my
bettering theirs; Nor indeed would it have
been so in the events, if some men had known
as well with moderation to use, as with earnestness
to desire advantages of doing good
or evill.</p>

<p>A continuall Parliament (I thought) would
but keep the Common-weale in tune, by preserving
Laws in their due execution and vigour:
wherein My interest lies more then any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[page 28]</span>
mans, since by those Laws My Rights as a
<span class="sc">King</span>, would be preserved no less then My
Subjects; which is all I desired. More then
the Law gives Me I would not have, and less
the meanest Subject should not.</p>

<p>Some (as <i>I</i> have heard) gave it out, that I
soon repented me of that setling Act: and
many would needs perswade Me, <i>I</i> had cause
so to do: But I could not easily nor suddenly
suspect such ingratitude in men of Honour,
That the more I granted them, the less <i>I</i>
should have and enjoy with them. <i>I</i> still counted
my self undiminished by my largest Concessions,
if by them <i>I</i> might gain and confirm
the love of My people.</p>

<p>Of which I do not yet despair, but that
God will still bless Me with increase of it,
when men shall have more leisure and less
prejudice; that so with unpassionate representations
they may reflect upon those (as I
think) not more Princely then friendly contributions,
which I granted toward the perpetuating
of their happiness: who are now only
miserable in this, That some mens ambition
will not give them leave to enjoy what I intended
for their good.</p>

<p>Nor do I doubt, but that in Gods due time,
the Loyal and cleared affections of My people
will strive to return such retributions of Honour
and love to Me or My Posteritie, as may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[page 29]</span>
fully compensate both the Acts of my confidence,
and my Sufferings for them; which
(God knows) have been neither few; nor
small, nor short; occasioned chiefly by a perswasion
I had, that I could not grant too much,
or distrust too little, to men, that being professedly
my Subjects, pretended singular piety,
and religious strictness.</p>

<p>The injurie of all Injuries is, That which
some men will needs load Me withall; as if I
were a wilfull and resolved Occasioner of my
Own, and my Subjects Miseries; while (as
they confidently, but (God knows) falsly divulge)
I repining at the establishment of this
Parliament, endeavoured by force and open
hostility, to undoe what by my Royall Assent I
had done. Sure, it had argued a very short
sight of things, and extreme fatuity of minde
in Me, so far to binde my Own hands at their
request, if I had shortly meant to have used a
sword against them. God knows, though I had
then a sense of Injuries; yet not such as to think
them worth vindicating by a War: I was not
then compelled, as since, to injure my Self by
their not using favours with the same candour
wherewith they were conferred. The Tumults
indeed threatned to abuse all Acts of Grace,
and turne them into wantonnesse; but I
thought at length their own fears, whose
black arts first raised up those turbulent spirits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[page 30]</span>
would force them to conjure them down again.</p>

<p>Nor if I had justly resented any indignities
put upon me, or others, was I then in any capacitie
to have taken just revenge in an hostile
and warlike way, upon those, whom I knew so
well fortified in the love of the meaner sort of
the people, that I could not have given my Enemies
greater and more desired advantages
against Me, then by so unprincely inconstancie,
to have assaulted them with Armies, thereby
to scatter them, whom but lately I had solemnly
setled by an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>God knows, I longed for nothing more,
then that my Self, and my Subjects might quietly
enjoy the fruits of my many Condescendings.</p>

<p>It had been a Course full of sin, as well as
of Hazard and Dishonor; for Me to go about
the cutting up of that by the Sword, which
I had so lately planted, so much (as I thought)
to my Subjects content, and mine Own too,
in all probability, if some men had not feared
where no fear was, whose security consisted in
fearing others.</p>

<p>I thank God, I know so well the sincerity
and uprightness of my own Heart in passing
that great <span class="sc">Bill</span>, which exceeded the very
thoughts of former times; That although I
may seem less a Polititian to men, yet I need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[page 31]</span>
no secret distinctions or evasions before God,
nor had I any reservations in my own Soul
when I passed it: nor repenting after, till I saw
that my letting some men go up to the pinnacle
of the Temple, was a temptation to them to
cast me down headlong.</p>

<p>Concluding, That without a miracle, Monarchie
it self, together with Me, could not
but be dashed in pieces by such a precipitous
fall as they intended: whom God in mercy
forgive, and make them see at length, That as
many Kingdoms as the Divell shewed our
Saviour, and the Glory of them (if they could
be at once enjoyed by them) are not worth the
gaining, by ways of sinfull ingratitude and
dishonour, which hazards a soul, worth more
Worlds then this hath Kingdoms.</p>

<p>But God hath hitherto preserved Me, and
made Me to see, That it is no strange thing
for men, left to their own passions, either to
do much evill themselves, or abuse the overmuch
goodness of others, whereof an ungratefull
surfet is the most desperate and incurable
disease.</p>

<p>I cannot say properly that I repent of that
Act, since <i>I</i> have no reflections upon it as a sin
of my Wil, though an errour of too charitable
a judgment: Only I am sorry other mens eys
should be evill, because mine were good.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">6. <i>Upon His Majesties retirement from</i> Westminster.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">W</span>
<b>Ith</b> what unwillingness I withdrew
from <i><b>Westminster</b></i>, let them
judg, who, unprovided of tackling
and victual, are forced to Sea by a Storm;
yet better do so, then venture splitting or sinking
on a Lee-shore.</p>

<p>I stayed at <i><b>Whitehall</b></i>, till I was driven away
by shame, more then fear, to see the barbarous
rudeness of those Tumults, who resolved
they would take the boldness to demand any
thing, and not leave either my Self, or the
Members of Parliament the liberty of our
Reason and Conscience to deny them any
thing.</p>

<p>Nor was this intolerable oppression my case
alone, (though chiefly Mine;) For the Lords
and Commons might be content to be over-voted
by the <i>major</i> part of their Houses, when
they had used each their own freedom.</p>

<p>Whose agreeing Votes were not by any Law
or reason conclusive to my Judgment; nor
can they include, or carry with them my consent,
whom they represent not in any kinde;
Nor am I further bound to agree with the
Votes of both Houses, then I see them agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[page 35]</span>
with the will of God, with my just Rights, as
a King, and the generall good of my people. I
see that, as many men, they are seldom of one
minde; and I may oft see, that the major part
of them are not in the right.</p>

<p>I had formerly declared to sober and moderate
minds, how desirous I was to give all
just content, when I agreed to so many Bils,
which had been enough to secure and satisfie
all; if some mens Hydropick unsatiableness
had not learned to thirst the more, by how
much more they drank; whom no fountain of
Royall bounty was able to overcome: so resolved
they seemed, either utterly to exhaust it,
or barbarously to obstruct it.</p>

<p>Sure, it ceases to be Counsell, when not
Reason is used, as to men, to perswade; but
force and terrour, as to beasts, to drive and
compel men to assent to what-ever tumultuary
Patrons shall project. He deserves to be a
slave without pity or redemption, that is content
to have the rationall soveraignty of his
Soul, and liberty of his Will and words so captivated.</p>

<p>Nor do I think my Kingdoms so considerable,
as to preserve them with the forfeiture
of that freedom which cannot be denied me as
a King, because it belongs to me as a man, and
a Christian, owning the dictates of none, but
God to be above me, as obliging me to consent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[page 36]</span>
Better for Me to die enjoying this Empire
of my Soul, which Subjects me only to
God, so farr as by Reason or Religion he directs
me, then live with the Title of a King, if
it should carry such a vassalage with it, as not
to suffer me to use my Reason and Conscience,
in which I declare as a King, to like or
dislike.</p>

<p>So farr am I from thinking the majesty of
the Crown of <i><b>England</b></i> to be bound by any
Coronation Oath in a blinde and brutish
formalitie, to consent to whatever its subjects
in Parliament shall require; as some men will
needs inferr; while denying me any power
of a Negative voice as King, they are not ashamed
to seek to deprive me of the libertie of
using my Reason with a good Conscience,
which themselves, and all the Commons of
<i><b>England</b></i> enjoy proportionable to their influence
on the publique; who would take it very
ill to be urged, not to deny, what ever my
self, as King, or the House of Peers with me
should, not so much desire as enjoyn them to
pass. I think my Oath fully discharged in
that point, by my Governing only by such
Laws, as my People with the House of
Peers have Chosen, and my self have consented
to. I shall never think my self conscientiously
tied to go as oft against my conscience,
as I should consent to such new Proposals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[page 37]</span>
which my Reason, in Justice, Honor and
Religion bids Me deny.</p>

<p>Yet so tender I see some men are of their being
subject to Arbitrary Government, (that is,
the Law of anothers will, to which themselves
give no consent) that they care not with how
much dishonour and absurdity they make their
King the only man, that must be subject to the
will of others, without having power left Him
to use His own Reason, either in Person, or by
any other Representation.</p>

<p>And if My dissentings at any time were (as
som have suspected, and uncharitably avowed)
out of error, opinion, activeness, weakness,
or wilfulness, and what they call Obstinacy
in Me (which not true Judgment of things,
but some vehement prejudice or passion hath
fixed on My minde;) yet can no man think it
other then the Badge and method of Slavery,
by savage rudeness, and importunate obtrusions
of violence, to have the mist of his Errour
and Passion dispelled, which is a shadow of
Reason, and must serve those that are destitute
of the substance. Sure that man cannot be
blameable to God or man, who seriously endeavours
to see the best reason of things, and
faithfully followes what he takes for Reason:
The uprightnesse of his intentions will excuse
the possible failings of his understanding; If a
Pilot at Sea cannot see the Pole-star, it can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[page 38]</span>
be no fault in him to steer his course by such
Stars as do best appear to him. It argues rather,
those men to be conscious of their defects
of Reason, and convincing Arguments, who
call in the assistance of meer force to carry on
the weakness of their Counsels and Proposals.
I may, in the truth and uprightness of
my heart, protest before God and men, That
I never wilfully opposed, or denied any thing
that was in a fair way, after full and free debates
propounded to me by the two Houses,
further then I thought in good reason I might,
and was bound to do.</p>

<p>Nor did any thing ever please me more,
then when my Judgment so concurred with
theirs, that I might with a good Conscience
consent to them: Yea, in many things, where
not absolute and morall necessity of Reason,
but temporary convenience in point of Honour
was to be considered, I chose rather to
deny my Self, then Them; as preferring that
which they thought necessary for my peoples
good, before what I saw but convenient for
my Self.</p>

<p>For I can be content to recede much from
my Own Interests, and Personall Rights, of
which I conceive my Self to be master: but in
what concerns Truth, Justice, the Right of
the Church, and my Crown, together with
the generall good of my Kingdoms: (all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[page 39]</span>
which I am bound to preserve as much as
morally lies in me;) here I am, and ever shall
be fixt and resolute, nor shall any man gain my
consent to that, wherein my heart gives my
hand or tongue the Lie; nor will I be brought
to affirm that to men, which in my Conscience
I denied before God. I will rather chuse
to wear a Crown of Thorns with my Saviour,
then to exchange that of Gold (which
is due to Me) for one of Lead, whose embased
flexibleness shall be forced to bend, and comply
to the various, and oft contrary dictates of
any Factions: when in stead of Reason, and
Publick concernments, they obtrude nothing
but what makes for the interest of parties, and
flows from the particularities of private wils
and passions.</p>

<p>I know no resolutions more worthy a Christian
King, then to prefer His Conscience before
His Kingdoms.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">A</span>
<b>Lthough</b> I have much cause to be
troubled at My Wifes departure from
Me, and out of My Dominions; yet
not Her absence, so much, as the scandall of
that necessity which drives her away, doth
afflict Me. That She should be compelled by
my own Subjects, and those pretending to be
Protestants, to withdraw for Her safety:
This being the first example of any Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[page 42]</span>
Subjects, that have taken up Arms against their
King, a Protestant: For I look upon this now
done in England, as another Act of the same
Tragedie which was lately begun in Scotland;
the brands of that fire being ill quenched, have
kindled the like flames here. I fear such motions
(so little to the adorning of the Protestant
profession) may occasion a further alienation
of mind, and divorce of affections in Her
from that Religion, which is the onely thing
wherein we differ.</p>

<p>Which yet God can (and I pray he would) in
time take away; and not suffer these practices
to be any obstruction to Her judgment, since it
is the motion of those men (for the most part)
who are yet to seek and settle their Religion
for Doctrine, Government and good manners,
and so not to be imputed to the true English
Protestants, who continue firm to their former
setled Principles and Laws.</p>

<p>I am sorry my relation to so deserving a
Ladie, should be any occasion of her danger
and affliction; whose merits would have served
her for a protection among the savage Indians:
while their rudeness and barbaritie
knows not so perfectly to hate all Vertues, as
some mens subtiltie doth: among whom I yet
think few are so malicious as to hate Her for
her Self: The fault it, that She is my Wife.</p>

<p>All Justice then, as well as Affection, commands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[page 43]</span>
me to studie her Securitie, who is only
in danger for my sake; I am content to be tossed,
weather-beaten, and shipwrack'd, so as she
may be in safe Harbour.</p>

<p>This comfort I shall injoy by her safety in
the midst of my Personall dangers, that I can
perish but half, if she be preserved: in whose
memory and hopefull Posterity, I may yet survive
the malice of my Enemies, although they
should be satiated with my bloud.</p>

<p>I must leave her and them to the Love and
Loyaltie of my good Subjects; and to his protection,
who is able to punish the faults of
Princes, and no less able to revenge the injuries
done to them, by those who in all dutie and
Allegiance ought to have made good that
safetie, which the Laws chiefly provide for
Princes.</p>

<p>But common civilitie is in vain expected
from those that dispute their Loyaltie: Nor
can it be safe (for any relation) to a King, to
tarry among them that are shaking hands with
their Allegiance, under pretence of laying faster
hold on their Religion.</p>

<p>'Tis pitie so noble and peaceful a Soul should
see, much more suffer the rudeness of those,
who must make up their want of Justice, with
inhumanity and impudence.</p>

<p>Her sympathie with Me in my afflictions,
will make her vertue shine with greater lustre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[page 44]</span>
as starrs in the darkest nights; and assure the
envious world, that she loves me, not my fortunes.</p>

<p>Neither of us but can easily forgive, since We
do not much blame the unkindness of the Generality
and Vulgar: for we see God is pleased
to try both our patience, by the most self-punishing
sin, the Ingratitude of those, who having
eaten of Our bread, and being enriched with
Our bounty, have Scornfully lift up themselves
against Us; and those of Our own
Houshold are become Our enemies. I pray
God lay not their sinne to their charge: who
think to satisfie all obligations to duty, by their
Corban of Religion: and can less endure to see,
then to sin against their benefactors as well as
their Soveraign.</p>

<p>But even that policy of my enemies is so farr
veniall, as it was necessary to their designs, by
scandalous articles, and all irreverent demeanour,
to seek to drive her out of my Kingdoms;
left by the influence of her example, eminent
for love as a Wife, and loyaltie as a Subject, she
should have converted to, or retained in their
love and loyaltie, all those whom they had a
purpose to pervert.</p>

<p>The less I may be blest with her company,
the more I will retire to God and my own
Heart, whence no malice can banish Her. My
enemies may envie, but they can never deprive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[page 45]</span>
me of the enjoyment of her vertues, while I
enjoy my self.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">8. <i>Upon His Majesties repulse at</i> Hull, <i>and the fates of the</i> Hothams.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">M</span>
<b>Y</b> repulse at <i>Hull</i> seemed at the first
view an act of so rude disloyalty, that
my greatest Enemies had scarce confidence
enough to abett or own it: It was the
first overt Essay to be made, how patiently I
could bear the losse of my Kingdoms.</p>

<p>God knows, it affected me more with shame
and sorrow for others, then with anger for my
Self; nor did the affront done to me, trouble
me so much as their sin, which admitted no
colour or excuse.</p>

<p>I was resolved how to bear this, and much
more with patience: But I foresaw they could
hardly contain themselves within the compass
of this one unworthy act, who had effrontery
enough to commit or countenance it.
This was but the hand of that cloud, which
was soon after to overspread the whole Kingdom,
and cast all into disorder and darkness.</p>

<p>For 'tis among the wicked Maximes of bold
and disloyall undertakers: That bad actions
must always be seconded with worse, and rather
not begun, then not carried on; for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[page 48]</span>
think the retreat more dangerous then the
assault, and hate repentance more then perseverance
in a fault.</p>

<p>This gave me to see clearly thorow all the
pious disguises, and soft palliations of some
men; whose words were sometime smoother
then oil, but now I saw they would prove very
swords.</p>

<p>Against which I having (as yet) no defence,
but that of a good Conscience, thought it My
best policie (with patience) to bear what I
could not remedie: And in this (I thank God)
I had the better of <i><b>Hotham</b></i>, that no disdain, or
emotion of passion transported Me, by the indignitie
of his carriage, to do or say any thing
unbeseeming My self, or unsuitable to that
temper, which, in greatest injuries, I think,
best becomes a Christian, as coming nearest to
the great example of Christ.</p>

<p>And indeed, I desire alwaies more to remember
I am a Christian, then a King; for what the
Majesty of one might justly abhor, the Charity
of the other is willing to bear; what the height
of a King tempteth to revenge, the humilitie of
a Christian teacheth to forgive, keeping in
compass all those impotent passions, whose
excess injures a man more then his greatest enemies
can; for these give their malice a full
impression on our souls, which otherwise cannot
reach very far, nor do us much hurt.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[page 49]</span>

<p>I cannot but observe how God not long after
so pleaded and avenged my cause, in the eye
of the world, that the most wilfully blind cannot
avoid the displeasure to see it, and with
some remorse and fears to own it as a notable
stroke, and prediction of divine vengeance.</p>

<p>First, Sir <i><b>John Hotham</b></i> unreproched, unthreatned,
uncursed by any language or secret
imprecation of mine, onely blasted with the
conscience of his own wickednesse, and falling
from one inconstancy to another, not long
after paies his own and his eldest Sons heads,
as forfeiture of their disloyalty, to those men,
from whom surely he might have expected an
other reward, then thus to divide their heads
from their bodies, whose hearts with them
were divided from their <span class="sc">King</span>.</p>

<p>Nor is it strange that they who employed
them at first in so high a service, and so successfull
to them, should not finde mercy enough
to forgive Him, who had so much premerited
of them: For, Apostacy unto Loyalty some
men account the most unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>Nor did a solitary vengeance serve the turn,
the cutting off one head in a Family is not enough
to expiate the affront done to the head
of the Common-weal. The eldest Son must be
involved in the punishment, as he was infected
with the sin of the Father, against the Father
of his Country: Root and branch God cuts off
in one day.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[page 50]</span>

<p>These Observations are obvious to every
fancie: God knows, I was so far from rejoycing
in the <i>Hothams</i> ruine, (though it
were such as was able to give the greatest
thirst for revenge a full draught, being executed
by them who first employed him against
Me) that I so far pitied him, as I thought he at
first acted more against the light of his Conscience,
then I hope many other men do in the
same Cause.</p>

<p>For, he was never thought to be of that
superstitious sowrenesse which some men pretend
to in matters of Religion, which so darkens
their judgment, that they cannot see any
thing of Sin and Rebellion in those means they
use, with intents to reform to their Models, of
what they call Religion, who think all is gold
of Piety, which doth but glister with a shew of
Zeal and Fervencie.</p>

<p>Sir <i><b>John Hotham</b></i> was (I think) a man of another
temper, and so most liable to those downright
temptations of Ambition, which have no
cloak or cheat of Religion to impose upon
themselves or others.</p>

<p>That which makes me more pitie him, is,
that after he began to have some inclinations
towards a repentance for his sin, and reparation
of his duty to Me, he should be so unhappie
as to fall into the hands of their Justice,
and not my mercie, who could as willingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[page 51]</span>
have forgiven him, as he could have asked that
favor of Me.</p>

<p>For I think clemency a debt which we
ought to pay to those that crave it, when we
have cause to believe they would not after abuse
it, since God himself suffers us not to pray
any thing for his mercie, but only praiers and
praises.</p>

<p>Poor Gentleman, he is now become a noteable
monument of unprosperous disloialtie,
teaching the world by so bad and unfortunate
a spectacle, that the rude carriage of a Subject
towards his Soveraign carries alwaies its own
vengeance, &amp; an unseparable shadow with it,
and those oft prove the most fatall, and implacable
Executioners of it, who were the first
Imployers in the service.</p>

<p>After-times will dispute it, whether <i><b>Hotham</b></i>
were more infamous at <i>Hull</i>, or at <i>Tower-hill</i>;
though 'tis certain that no punishment so
stains a mans Honour, as wilfull expectations
of unworthy actions; which besides the conscience
of the sin, brands with most indeliable
characters of infamy, the name and memory
to posterity, who not engaged in the Faction
of the times, have the most impartiall reflections
on their actions.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">I</span>
<b>Find</b> that I am at the same point and posture
I was, when they forced me to leave
<i><b>White-hall</b></i>: what tumults could not do,
an Army must; which is but Tumults lifted,
and enrolled to a better order, but as bad an
end: My recesse have given them confidence
that I may be conquered.</p>

<p>And so I easily may as to any outward
strength, which, God knows, is little or none
at all: But I have a Soul invinciable through
Gods Grace enabling Me; here I am sure to
be Conquerour, if God will give me such a
measure of Constancy, as to fear him more
then man: and to love the inward peace of
my Conscience, before any outward tranquillity.</p>

<p>And must I be opposed with force, because
they have not reason whereby to convince
me? O my Soule! be of good courage, they
confesse their known weaknesse, as to truth,
and Justice, who chose rather to contend by
Armies, then by Arguments.</p>

<p>Is this the reward and thanks that I am to
receive for those many acts of Grace I have
lately passed, and for those many Indignities I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[page 55]</span>
have endured? Is there no way left to make
Me a glorious <span class="sc">King</span>, but by my sufferings?</p>

<p>It is a hard and disputable choice for a King
that loves his People, and desires their love,
either to kill his own Subjects, or to be killed
by them.</p>

<p>Are the hazards and miseries of Civil War
in the bowels of my most flourishing Kingdom,
the fruits I must now reap after 17 yeers
living and reigning among them with such a
measure of Justice, Peace, Plenty, and Religion,
as all Nations about either admired, or
envied? notwithstanding some miscarriages
in Government, which might escape, rather
through ill counsell of some men driving on
their private ends, or the peevishness of others
envying the Publick should be managed without
them, or the hidden and insuperable necessities
of State, then any propensity, I hope, of
my Self either to injuriousnesse or oppression.</p>

<p>Whose innocent bloud, during my Reign,
have I shed, to satisfie my lust, anger, or covetousness?
what Widows or Orphans tears can
witnesse against me; the just cry of which must
now be avenged with my Own bloud? For
the hazards of War are equall, nor doth the
Canon know any respect of persons.</p>

<p>In vain is my Person excepted by a Parenthesis
of words, when so many hands are armed
against me with Swords.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[page 56]</span>

<p>God knowes how much I have studied to
see what Ground of Justice is alledged for this
Warr against Me; that so I might (by giving
just satisfaction) either prevent, or soon end
so unnaturall a motion; which (to many men)
seems rather the productions of a surfeit of
peace and wantonness of mindes, or of private
discontents, Ambition and Faction (which
easily finde, or make causes of quarrell) then
any reall obstructions of publique Justice, or
Parliamentary Priviledg.</p>

<p>But this is pretended, and this I must be able
to avoid and answer before God in My owne
Conscience, however some men are not willing
to beleeve Me, lest they should condemn
themselves.</p>

<p>When I first with-drew from <i><b>White-hall</b></i>, to
see if I could allay the insolency of the Tumults
(for the not suppressing of which, no account
in Reason can be given, (where an orderly
Guard was granted) but only to oppress
both Mine and the Two Houses freedome of
declaring and voting according to every mans
Conscience) what obstructions of Justice were
there further then this, that what seemed just
to one man, might not seem so to another?</p>

<p>Whom did I by power protect against the
Justice of Parliament?</p>

<p>That some men with-drew, who feared the
partiality of their tryall, (warned by my Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[page 57]</span>
of <i><b>Straffords</b></i> death) while the vulgar threatned
to be their Oppressors, and Judgers of their
Judges, was from that instinct which is in all
creatures to preserve themselves. If any others
refused to appear, where they evidently saw
the current of Justice and Freedom so stopped
and troubled by the Rabble, that their lawfull
Judges either durst not come to the House, or
not declare their sense with liberty and safety;
it cannot seem strange to any reasonable man,
when the sole exposing them to publick <i><b>odium</b></i>
was enough to ruine them before their Cause
could be heard or tryed.</p>

<p>Had not factious Tumults over-born the
Freedom and Honour of the two Houses, had
they asserted their Justice against them, and
made the way open for all the Members quietly
to come and declare their Consciences: I
know no man so deer to Me, whom I had
the least inclination to advise, either to withdraw
himself, or deny appearing upon their
Summons, to whose Sentence according to
Law, I think every Subject bound to stand.</p>

<p>Distempers (indeed) were risen to so great a
height for want of timely suppressing the vulgar
insolencies, that the greatest guilt of those
which were Voted and demanded as Delinquents,
was this, That they would not suffer
themselves to be over-awed by the Tumults,
and their Patrons; nor compelled to abet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[page 58]</span>
by their suffrages, or presence; the designes of
those men who agitated innovations and ruine
both in Church and State.</p>

<p>In this point I could not but approve their
generous constancie and cautiousness; further
then this I did never allow any mans refractoriness
against the Priviledges and Orders of the
Houses; to whom I wished nothing more then
Safetie, Fulness and Freedom.</p>

<p>But the truth is, some men and those not many,
despairing in fair and Parliamentary waies
by free Deliberations and Votes to gain the
concurrence of the major part of Lords and
Commons, betook themselves (by the desperate
activitie of factious Tumults) to sift and terrifie
away all those Members whom they saw to be
of contrary minds to their purposes.</p>

<p>How oft was the businesse of the Bishops
enjoying their ancient places, and undoubted
Priviledges in the House of Peers, carried for
them by far the Major part of Lords? Yet
after five repulses, contrary to all Order and
Custome, it was by Tumultuary instigations
obtruded again, and by a few carried, when
most of the Peers were forced to absent themselves.</p>

<p>In like manner as the Bill against Root and
Branch, brought on by tumultuary Clamours,
and schismaticall Terrours, which could never
passe til both Houses were sufficiently thinned
and over-awed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[page 59]</span>

<p>To which partialitie, while in all Reason,
Justice, and Religion, my Conscience forbids
me, by consenting, to make up their Votes to
Acts of Parliament, I must now be urged with

<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and'">an</ins> Armie, and constrained either to hazard
my Own, and my Kingdoms ruine, by my
Defence, or prostrate my Conscience to the
blinde obedience of those men, whose zealous
superstition thinks, or pretends, they cannot
do God and the Church a greater service, then
utterly to destroy that Primitive, Apostolicall,
and anciently Universall Government of the
Church by Bishops.</p>

<p>Which, if other mens judgments bind them
to maintain, or forbids them to consent to the
abolishing of it, mine much more; who, besides
the grounds I have in my judgement,
have also a most strict and indispensable
Oath upon my Conscience, to preserve that
Order, and the Rights of the Church; to
which most Sacrilegious and abhorred Perjurie,
most un-beseeming a Christian King,
should I ever, by giving my consent, be betrayed,
I should account it infinitely greater miserie,
then any hath, or can befall me; in as
much as the least sin hath more evill in it
then the greatest affliction. Had I gratified
their Anti-Episcopall Faction at first in this
point with my Consent, and sacrificed the
Ecclesiasticall Government and Revenues to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[page 60]</span>
the fury of their covetousness, ambition, and
revenge, I beleeve they would then have found
no colourable necessity of raising an Army to
fetch in and punish Delinquents.</p>

<p>That I consented to the Bil of putting the Bishops
out of the House of Peers, was done
with a firm perswasion of their contentedness
to suffer a present diminution in their Rights
and Honour for my sake, and the Commonweals,
which I was confident they would readily
yeeld unto, rather then occasion (by the least
obstruction on their part) any dangers to Me,
or to my Kingdom. That I cannot add my
consent for the totall extirpation of that Government
(which I have often offered to all fit
regulations) hath so much further tie upon My
Conscience, as what I think Religious and Apostolicall,
and so very sacred and Divine, is
not to be dispensed with, or destroyed, when
what is onely of civill Favour, and priviledge of
Honour granted to men of that Order, may
with their consent who are concerned in it,
be annulled.</p>

<p>This is the true state of those obstructions
pretended to be in point of Justice and Authority
of Parliament; when I call God to witness,
I know none of such consequence as was
worth speaking of a War, being onely such as
Justice, Reason and Religion had made in my
own and other mens Consciences.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[page 61]</span>

<p>Afterwards indeed a great shew of Delinquents
was made, which were but consequences
necessarily following upon Mine, or others
withdrawing from, or defence against violence:
but those could not be the first occasion
of raising an Army against Me. Wherein I
was so far from preventing them, (as they
have declared often, that they might seem to
have the advantage and Justice of the defensive
part, and load Me with all the envie and
injuries of first assaulting them) that (God
knows) I had not so much as any hopes of an
Army in My thoughts. Had the Tumults
been honourably and effectually repressed by
exemplary justice, and the Liberty of the Houses
so vindicated, that all Members of either
House might with Honour and Freedom, becoming
such a Senate, have come and discharged
their Consciences, I had obtained all that
I designed by My withdrawing, and had much
more willingly and speedily returned, then I
retired; this being My necessity driving, the
other my choice desiring.</p>

<p>But some men knew, I was like to bring the
same Judgment and Constancy which I carryed
with Me, which would never fit their designes;
and so while they invited Me to come,
and grievously complained of My absence, yet
they could not but be pleased with it: especially,
when they had found out that plausible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[page 62]</span>
and popular pretexts of raising an Army to
fetch in Delinquents: when all that while they
never punished the greatest and most intolerable
delinquencie of the Tumults, and their Exciters,
which drave my Self, and so many of
both Houses from their places, by most barbarous
indignities; which yet in all Reason and
Honour, they were as loath to have deserted,
as those others were willing they should, that
so they might have occasion to persecute them
with the injuries of an Army, for not suffering
more tamely the injuries of Tumults.</p>

<p>That this is the true state, and first drift and
designe in raising an Army against me, is by the
sequel so evident, that all other pretences
vanish. For when they declared by Propositions,
or Treaties, what they would have to appease
them; there was nothing of consequence
offered to Mee, or demanded of Mee, as any
originall difference in any point of Law, or
order of Justice. But among other lesser Innovations,
this chiefly was urged, The Abolition
of Episcopall, and the Establishment of
Presbyterian Government.</p>

<p>All other things at any time propounded
were either impertinent as to any ground of a
War, or easily granted by me, and onely to
make up a number; or else they were meerly
consequentiall, and accessarie, after the War
was by them unjustly began.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[page 63]</span>

<p>I cannot hinder other mens thoughts, whom
the noise and shew of piety, and heat of Reformation
and Religion, might easily so fill
with prejudice, that all equality and clearness
of judgement might be obstructed. But this
was, and is, as to my best observation, the true
state of affairs between Us, when they first
raised an Armie, with this designe, either to
stop my mouth, or to force my consent: and
in this truth, as to my conscience, (who was
God knowes, as far from meditating a War,
as I was in the eye of the world, from having
any preparation for one) I finde that comfort,
that in the midst of all the unfortunate Successes
of this War, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'one'">on</ins> my side, I do not think
my Innocency any whit prejudiced or darkned;
Nor am I without that Integrity and
Peace before God, as with humble confidence
to address my Prayer to Him.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>For thou, O Lord, seest cleerly thorow all the

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">H</span>
<b>Ow</b> untruly I am charged with the
first raising of an Army, and beginning
this Civill Warre, the eyes that
onely pitty Me, and the Loyall hearts that
durst only pray for me, at first, might witnesse,
which yet appear not so many on my side, as
there were men in Armes lifted against me; my
unpreparednesse for a War may well dis-hearten
those that would help Me; while it argues
(truly) my willingnes to fight; yet it testifies
for me, that I am set on the defensive part;
having so little hopes or power to defend others,
that I have none to defend my self, or to
preserve what is mine own from their proreption.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[page 67]</span>

<p>No man can doubt but they prevented me
in their purposes, as well as their injuries, who
are so much before-hand in their preparations
against me, and surprisals of my Strength.
Such as are not for Them, yet dare not be for
Me; so over-aw'd is their Loyalty by the others
numbers and terrours. I believe my innocency
and unpreparedness to assert my
Rights and Honour, makes me the more guilty
in their esteems; who would not so easily
have declared a War against me, if I had first
assaulted them.</p>

<p>They knew, my chiefest Arms left me,
were those only which the Ancient Christians
were wont to use against their Persecutors,
Prayers and Tears. These may serve a good
mans turn, if not to conquer as a Souldier, yet
to suffer as a Martyr.</p>

<p>Their preventing of me, and surprising my
Castles, Forts, Arms and Navy, with the
Militia, is so far best for me, That it may
drive me from putting any trust in the arm of
flesh, and wholly to cast my self into the protection
of the living God, who can save by
few or none, as well as by many.</p>

<p>He that made the greedy Ravens to be Elias
Caterers, and bring him food, may also make
their surprisall of outward force and defence,
an opportunity to shew me the special support
of his power and protection.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[page 68]</span>

<p>I thank God, I reckon not now the want of
the <i><b>Militia</b></i> so much in reference to my own
protection, as my Peoples.</p>

<p>Their many and sore oppressions grieve me,
I am above mine own: What I want in the
hands of Force and Power, I have in the wings
of Faith and Prayer.</p>

<p>But this is the strange method these men will
needs take to resolve their riddle of Making
Me a glorious King, by taking away my Kingly
power: Thus I shall become a Support to
my Friends, and a Terrour to my Enemies, by
being unable to succour the one, or suppress
the other.</p>

<p>For thus have they designed and proposed
to me the new modeling of Soveraignty and
Kingship, as without any reality of power, so
without any necessity of subjection and obedience:
That the Majesty of the Kings of England
might hereafter hang like Mahomet's
Tomb, by a magnetique Charm, between the
Power and Priviledges of the two Houses, in
an airy imagination of Regality.</p>

<p>But I beleeve the surfet of too much power,
which some men have greedily seized on, and
now seek wholly to devour, will ere long make
the Common-wealth sick both of it and them,
since they cannot well digest it; Soveraign
Power in Subjects seldom agreeing with the
stomacks of fellow-subjects.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[page 69]</span>

<p>Yet I have even in this point of the constant
Militia, sought, by satisfying their fears and
importunities, both to secure my Friends, and
overcome mine Enemies, to gain the peace of
all, by depriving my self of a sole power to help,
or hurt any: yeelding the Militia, (which is
my undoubted Right no less then the Crown)
to be disposed of as the two Houses shall
think fit, during my time.</p>

<p>So willing am I to bury all jealousies in
them of me, and to live above all jealousies of
them, as to my self; I desire not to be safer
then I wish them and my People: If I had
the sole actuall disposing of the Militia, I
could not protect my People, further then
they protected Me and Themselves: so that
the use of the Militia is mutuall. I would but
defend my self so far, as to be able to defend
my good Subjects from those mens violence
and fraud, who conscious to their own evill
merits and designes, will needs perswade the
world, that none but Wolves are fit to be
trusted with the custody of the Shepherd and
his Flock. Miserable experience hath taught
my Subjects, since power hath been wrested
from Me, and imployed against Me and Them,
that neither can be safe, if both be not in such
a way as the Law hath intrusted the publike
safety and welfare.</p>

<p>Yet even this Concession of mine, as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[page 70]</span>
exercise of the Militia, so vast and large, is not
satisfactory to some men; which seem to be
Enemies not to me only, but to all Monarchy;
and are resolved to transmit to posterity
such Jealousies of the Crown, as they should
never permit it to enjoy its just and necessary
Rights in point of power; to which (at last)
all Law is resolved, while thereby it is best
protected.</p>

<p>But here Honour and Justice due to my Successors,
forbid me to yeeld to such total alienation
of that power from them, which civility
and duty, no less then Justice and Honour
should have forbad them to have asked of me.</p>

<p>For, although I can be content to Eclypse
my own beams, to satisfie their fears; who
think they must needs be scorched or blinded,
if I should shine in the full lustre of Kingly
power wherewith God and the Laws have
invested me: Yet I will never consent to put
out the Sun of Soveraignty to all posterity,
and succeeding Kings; whose just recovery
of their Rights from unjust Usurpations and
Extortions, shall never be prejudiced or obstructed
by any Act of mine; which indeed,
would not be more injurious to succeeding
Kings, then to my Subjects; whom I desire
to leave in a condition not wholly desperate
for the future; so as by a Law to be ever subjected
to those many factious distractions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[page 71]</span>
which must needs follow the many-headed
<i><b>Hydra</b></i> of Government: which as it makes a
shew to the people to have more eyes to foresee;
so they will find it hath more mouths
too, which must be satisfied: and (at best) it
hath rather a monstrosity, then any thing of
perfection, beyond that of right Monarchy;
where counsell may be in many as the senses,
but the Supreme Power can be but in One as
the Head.</p>

<p>Happily where men have tried the horrours
and malignant influence which will certainly
follow my enforced darkness and Eclypse,
(occasioned by the interposition and shadow
of that body, which as the Moon receiveth its
chiefest lights from me) which will at length
more esteem and welcome the restored glory
and blessing of the Suns light.</p>

<p>And if at present I may seem by My receding
so much from the use of my Right in the
Power of the <i><b>Militia</b></i>, to come short of the
discharge of that trust to which I am sworn
for my peoples protection; I conceive those
men are guilty of the inforced perjury; (if so
it may seem) who compell me to take this new
and strange way of discharging my trust, by
seeming to desert it; of protecting my Subjects,
by exposing my self to danger or dishonour,
for their safety and quiet.</p>

<p>Which in the conflicts of Civill War and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[page 72]</span>
advantages of power, cannot be effected but
by some side yeilding; to which the greatest
love of the publique peace, and the firmest
assurance of Gods protection (arising from a
good Conscience) doth more invite me, then
can be expected from other mens fears; which
arising from the injustice of their actions
(though never so successfull) yet dare not adventure
their Authours upon any other way
of safety then that of the Sword and Militia;
which yet are but weak defences against the
stroaks of divine Vengeance, which will overtake;
or of mens own Consciences, which alwayes
attend injurious perpetrations.</p>

<p>For my self, I do not think that I can want
any thing which providential necessity is pleased
to take from me, in order to my Peoples
tranquillity and Gods glory, whose protection
is sufficient for me; and he is able by his being
with me, abundantly to compensate to me,
as he did to Job, what-ever Honour, Power,
or Liberty the Chaldeans, the Sabeans, or the
Divel himself can deprive me of.</p>

<p>Although they take from me all defence of
Arms and Militia, all refuge by Land of
Forts and Castles, all flight by Sea in my
Ships and Navie; yea, though they study to
rob me of the Hearts of my Subjects, the
greatest Treasure and best Ammunition of a
King; yet cannot they deprive me of my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[page 73]</span>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">A</span>
<b>Lthough</b> there be many things, they
demand, yet if these be all, I am glad
to see at what price they set my own
safety, and my peoples peace; which I cannot
think I buy at too dear a rate, save only
the parting with my Conscience and Honor.
If nothing else will satisfie, I must chuse rather
to be as miserable and inglorious, as My
enemies can make or wish me.</p>

<p>Some things here propounded to me have
been offered by me; others are easily granted;
The rest (I think) ought not to be obtruded
upon me, with the point of the sword; nor
urged with the injuries of a Warr; when I
have already declared that I cannot yeeld to
them, without violating my Conscience: 'tis
strange, there can be no method of peace, but
by making war upon my soul.</p>

<p>Here are many things required of me, but I
see nothing offer'd to me, by the way of gratefull
Exchange of Honour; or any requitall
or those favours, I have, or can yet grant
them.</p>

<p>This Honour they do me, to put Me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[page 76]</span>
on the giving part, which is more princely and
divine. They cannot ask more then I can
give, may I but reserve to my Self the incommunicable
Jewell of my Conscience; and not
be forced to part with that, whose loss nothing
can repair or requite.</p>

<p>Some things (which they are pleased to propound)
seem unreasonable to Me; and while
I have any mastery of my Reason, how can
they think I can consent to them; who know
they are such as are inconsistent with being
either a King, or a good Christian? My yeilding
so much (as I have already) makes some
men confident I will deny nothing.</p>

<p>The love I have of my peoples peace, hath
(indeed) great influence upon Me; but the love
of truth and inward peace hath more.</p>

<p>Should I grant some things they require, I
should not so much weaken my outward state
of a King, as wound that inward quiet of my
Conscience; which ought to be, is, and ever
shall be (by Gods Grace) dearer to Me then
my Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Some things which a King might approve,
yet in Honour and Policy are at some time to
be denied, to some men, lest he should seem
not to dare to deny any thing; and give too
much incouragement to unreasonable demands
or importunities.</p>

<p>But to bind my Self to a generall and implicite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[page 77]</span>
consent to what-ever they shall desire or
propound, (for such is one of their <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Popositions'">Propositions</ins>)
were such a latitude of blind obedience,
as never was expected from any Free-men, nor
fit to be required of any man, much less of a
King by his own Subjects; any of whom he
may possibly exceed as much in wisdom, as he
doth in place and power.</p>

<p>This were, as if <i><b>Samson</b></i> should have consented,
not only to bind his own hands, and cut
off his hair, but to put out his own eys, that
the Philistins might with the more safety mock
and abuse him; which they chose rather to do,
then quite destroy him, when he was become
so tame an object, and fit occasion for their
sport and scorn.</p>

<p>Certainly, to exclude all power of denyall,
seems an arrogancy least of all becoming
those who pretend to make their Addresses in
an humble and loyall way of petitioning; who
by that, sufficiently confess their own inferiority,
which obligeth them to rest, if not
satisfied, yet quieted, with such an Answer as
the Will and Reason of their Superiour thinks
fit to give; who is acknowledged to have a
freedom and power of Reason, to Consent or
Dissent, else it were very foolish and absurd to
ask, what another having not liberty to deny,
neither hath power to grant.</p>

<p>But if this be my Right belonging to Me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[page 78]</span>
in Reason as a Man, and in Honour as a Soveraign
King (as undoubtedly it doth) how can
it be other then extreme injury to confine my
Reason to a necessity of granting all they have
a mind to ask, whose minds may be as differing
from mine, both in reason and honour, as their
aims may be, and their qualities are? which last
God and the Laws have sufficiently distinguisht,
making me their Soveraign, and them
my Subjects: whose Propositions may soon
prove violent oppositions, if once they gain to
be necessary impositions upon the Regall Authority;
Since no man seeks to limit and confine
his King in Reason, who hath not a secret
aim to share with him, or usurp upon him in
Power and Dominion.</p>

<p>But they would have me trust to their moderation,
and abandon mine own discretion; that
so I might verifie what representations some
have made of me to the world, that I am fitter
to be their Pupil then their Prince. Truly, I am
not so confident of my own sufficiency, as not
willingly to admit the Counsel of others: But
yet I am not so diffident of my self, as brutishly
to submit to any mans dictates, and at
once to betray the Soveraignty of Reason in
my soul, and the Majesty of my own Crown
to any of my Subjects.</p>

<p>Least of all have I any ground of credulity,
to induce me fully to submit to all the desires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[page 79]</span>
of those men, who will not admit, or do refuse,
and neglect to vindicate the freedom of
their own and others Sitting and Voting in
Parliament.</p>

<p>Besides, all men that knew them, knew
this, how young States-men the most part
of these propounders are; so that till experience
of one seven years have shewed me how
well they can govern themselves, and so much
power as is wrested from me, I should be
very foolish indeed, and unfaithful in my
Trust, to put the reins of both Reason and
Government wholly out of my Own, into
their hands, whose driving is already too much
like <i><b>Jehues</b></i>; and whose forwardnesse to ascend
the throne of Supremacie pretends more of
<i><b>Phaeton</b></i> then of <i><b>Phebus</b></i>; God divert the Omen
of his will.</p>

<p>They may remember that at best they sit in
Parliament, as my Subjects, not my Superiours:
called to be My Counsellours, not
Dictatours: Their Summons extends to recommend
their Advice, not to command my
Dutie.</p>

<p>When I first heard of Propositions to be sent
me, I expected either some good Laws which
had been antiquated by the course of time, or
overlaid by the corruption of manners, had
been desired to a restauration of their vigour
and due execution; or some evil Customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[page 80]</span>
preterlegall, and abuses personall had been to
be removed: or some injuries done by my
Self, and others, to the Common-weal, were
to be repaired: or some equable offertures
were to be tendred to Me, wherein the advantages
of my Crown being considered by
them, might fairly induce me to condescend
to what tended to my Subjects good, without
any great diminution of my Self, whom
Nature, Law, Reason and Religion binde Me
(in the first place) to preserve; without which
'tis impossible to preserve my people according
to my place.</p>

<p>Or (at least) I looked for such moderate
desires of due Reformation of what was (indeed)
amisse in Church and State, as might
still preserve the foundation and essentials of
Government in both; not shake and quite overthrow
either of them, without any regard
to the Laws in force, the wisdom and piety
of former Parliaments, the ancient, and universall
practice of Christian Churches; the
Rights and Priviledges of particular men:
Nor yet any thing offered in lieu, or in the
room of what must be destroyed, which
might at once reach the good end of the others
Institution, and also supply its pretended
defects, reform its abuses, and satisfie sober
and wise men, not with soft and specious
words, pretending zeal, and special piety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[page 81]</span>
but with pregnant and solid Reasons, both divine
and humane, which might justifie the
abruptnesse and necessity of such vast Alterations.</p>

<p>But in all their Propositions I can observe
little of these kindes, or to these ends: Nothing
of any Laws dis-jointed, which are to be restored;
of any right invaded; of any justice to
be unobstructed; of any compensations to be
made; of any impartiall Reformation to be
granted: to all or any of which Reason, Religion,
true Policy, or any other humane motives
might induce Me.</p>

<p>But as to the main matters propounded by
them at any time, in which is either great novelty
or difficulty, I perceive, that what were
formerly look'd upon as Factions in the State,
and Schisms in the Church, and so punishable
by the Laws, have now the confidence,
by vulgar clamours, and assistance (chiefly) to
demand not onely Tolerations of themselves,
in their vanity, novelty, and confusion; but
also Abolition of the Laws against them, and a
totall extirpation of that Government, whose
Rights they have a mind to invade.</p>

<p>This as to the main: Other Propositions
are (for the most part) but as waste paper in
which those are wrapped up, to present them
somewhat more handsomly.</p>

<p>Nor do I so much wonder at the variety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[page 82]</span>
and horrible noveltie of some Propositions,
(there being nothing so monstrous, which
some fancies are not prone to long for).</p>

<p>This casts me into, not an admiration, but
an extasie, how such things should have the
fortune to be propounded in the name of the
two Houses of the Parliament of England,
among whom, I am very confident, there was
not a fourth part of the Members of either
House, whose Judgements free, single and apart
did approve or desire such destructive
changes in the Government of the Church.</p>

<p>I am perswaded there remains in far the
Major part of both Houses (if free and full)
so much Learning, Reason, Religion, and just
Moderation, as to know how to sever between
the use and the abuse of things, the institution
and the corruption, the Government and
the mis-government, the Primitive Patterns
and the aberrations or blottings of after-Copies.</p>

<p>Sure they could not at all, upon so little, or
no Reason (as yet produced to the contrary)
so soon renounce all regard to the Laws in
force, to antiquity, to the piety of their Reforming
progenitors, to the prosperity of former
times in this Church and State, under the
present Government of the Church.</p>

<p>Yet, by a strange fatality, these men suffer,
either by their absence, or silence, or negligence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[page 83]</span>
or supine credulity (beleeving that all is
good, which is guilded with shewes of Zeal
and Reformation) their private dissenting in
Judgement to be drawn into the common
sewer or streame of the present vogue and
humour; which hath its chief rise and abetment
from those popular clamors and tumults:
which served to give life and strength to the
infinite activity of those men, who studied with
all diligence, and policy, to improve to their
innovating designes, the present distractions.</p>

<p>Such Armies of Propositions having so
little, in my judgment, of Reason, Justice, and
Religion on their side, as they had Tumult
and Faction for their rise, must not go alone,
but ever be backt and seconded, with Armies
of Souldiers; Though the second should prevaile
against my Person, yet that first shall never
overcome me further then I see cause; for,
I look not at their number and power, so
much as I weigh their Reason and Justice.</p>

<p>Had the two Houses first sued out their Livery,
and once effectually redeemed themselves
from the Wardship of the Tumults,
(which can be no other then the Hounds that
attend the cry and hollow of those men, who
hunt after factions and private Designes, to
the ruine of Church and State.)</p>

<p>Did my Judgement tell Me, that the propositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[page 84]</span>
sent to Me were the Results of the major
part of their Votes, who exercise their freedom,
as well as they have a right to sit in Parliament:
I should then suspect my Own judgment,
for not speedily and fully concurring
with every one of them.</p>

<p>For, I have charity enough to think there
are wise men among them: and humility to
think, that, as in some things I may want, so
'tis fit I should use their advice, which is the
end for which I called them to a Parliament.
But yet I cannot allow their wisdom such a
compleatness and inerrability as to exclude
my Self; since none of them hath that part to
act, that Trust to discharge, nor that Estate
and Honour to preserve, as my Self; without
whose Reason concurrent with theirs (as the
Suns influence is necessary in all Natures, productions)
they cannot beget, or bring forth any
one compleat and authoritative Act of publick
wisdom, which makes the Laws.</p>

<p>But the unreasonableness of some Propositions
is not more evident to me then this is,
That they are not the joynt and free desires
of those in their Major number, who are of
right to Sit and Vote in Parliament.</p>

<p>For, many of them favour very strong of
that old leaven of Innovations, masked under
the name of Reformation; (which in my Two
last famous Predecessours days heaved, at,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[page 85]</span>
and sometime threatned both Prince and Parliaments:)
But, I am sure, was never wont so
far to infect the whole masse of the Nobility
and Gentry of this Kingdom; how-ever it
dispersed among the Vulgar: Nor was it
likely so suddenly to taint the Major part of
both Houses, as that they should unanimously
desire, and effect so enormous and dangerous
innovations in Church and State, contrary to
their former education, practice, and judgment.</p>

<p>Not that I am ignorant, how the choice of
many Members was carried by much Faction
in the Countries; some thirsting after nothing
more then a passionate revenge of what-ever
displeasure they had conceived against Me, my
Court, or the Clergy.</p>

<p>But all Reason bids me impute these sudden
and vast desires of change to those few, who
armed themselves with the many-headed, and
many-handed Tumults.</p>

<p>No less doth Reason, Honour, and Safety
both of Church and State command me to
chew such morsels before I let them down;
If the straitness of my Conscience will not
give me leave to swallow down such Camels,
as others do, of Sacriledge, and injustice both
to God and man, they have no more cause to
quarrell with me, then for this, that my throat
is not so wide as theirs. Yet, by Gods help, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[page 86]</span>
am resolved, That nothing of passion or peevishnesse,
or list to contradict, or vanity to
shew my negative power, shall have any byas
upon my judgment, to make me gratifie my
will, by denying any thing which my Reason
and Conscience commands me not.</p>

<p>Nor on the other side, will I consent to more
then Reason, Justice, Honor and Religion perswade
me to be, for Gods glory, the Churches
good, my Peoples welfare, and my own
peace.</p>

<p>I will study to satisfie my Parliament, and
my People; but I will never for fear, or flatterie
gratifie any Faction, how potent soever;
for this were to nourish the disease, and oppresse
the body.</p>

<p>Although many mens loyalty and prudence
are terrified from giving me, that free and faithfull
counsel, which they are able and willing to
impart, and I may want; yet none can hinder
me from craving of the councell of that mighty
Counsellor who can both suggest what is best,
and incline my heart stedfastly to follow
it.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">12. <i>Upon the Rebellion, and troubles in</i> Ireland.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>He</b> Commotions in <i><b>Ireland</b></i> were so sudden,
and so violent, that it was hard at first
either to discern the rise, or apply a remedie to
that precipitant Rebellion.</p>

<p>Indeed that Sea of blood, which hath there bin
cruelly &amp; barbarously shed, is enough to drown
any man in eternall both infamy and misery,
whom God shall find the malicious Author or
Instigator of its effusion.</p>

<p>It fell out, as a most unhappy advantage to
some mens malice against me; that when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[page 90]</span>
had impudence enough to lay any thing to my
charge, this bloody oppertunity should be offered
them, with which I must be aspersed. Although
there was nothing which could be more
abhorred to me, being so ful of sin against God,
disloyalty to myself, and destructive to my
Subjects.</p>

<p>Some men took it very ill not to be beleeved,
when they affirmed, that what the Irish
Rebels did, was done with my privitie (at least)
if not by my Commission: But these knew too
well, that it is no news for som of my Subjects
to fight not only without my Commission, but
against my Command, and Person too, yet all
the while to pretend, they fight by my Authoritie,
and for my safety.</p>

<p>I would to God the <i>Irish</i> had nothing to alledge
for their imitation against those whose
blame must needs be the greater, by how much
Protestant Principles are more against all Rebellion
against Princes, then those of Papists.
Nor wil the goodnes of mens intentions excuse
the scandall, and contagion of their examples.</p>

<p>But who ever fail of their Dutie toward me,
I must bear the blame; this honour my enemies
have alwayes done me, to think moderate injuries
not proportionate to me, nor competent
trials, either of my patience under them, or my
pardon of them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[page 91]</span>

<p>Therefore with exquisite malice they have
mixed the gall and vinegar of falsity and contempt,
with the cup of my Affliction; charging
Me not only with untruths, but such, as wherin
I have the greatest share of loss &amp; dishonor by
what is comitted; wherby, (in all policy, reason
and Religion, having least cause to give the least
consent, and most grounds of utter detestation)
I might be represented by them to the world,
the more inhumane and barbarous: Like some
Cyclopick monster, whom nothing will serve
to eat and drink, but the flesh and bloud of
my own Subjects; in whose common welfare
my interest lies, as much as some mens doth in
their perturbations: who think they cannot do
wel but in evil times; nor so cunningly, as in
laying the <i><b>odium</b></i> of those sad events on others,
wherewith themselves are most pleased, and
whereof they have been not the least occasion.</p>

<p>And certainly, 'tis thought by many wise
men, that the preposterous rigour and unreasonable
severity, which some men carried before
them in <i><b>England</b></i>, was not the least incentive,
that kindled, and blew up into those
horrid flames, the sparks of discontent, which
wanted not pre-disposed fewel for Rebellion
in <i><b>Ireland</b></i>; where dispair being added to their
former discontents, and the fear of utter extirpation
to their wonted oppressions, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[page 92]</span>
easie to provoke to an open Rebellion a people
prone enough to break out into all exorbitant
violence, both by some principles of their
Religion, and the naturall desires of liberty;
both to exempt themselves from their present
restraints, and to prevent those after rigours,
wherewith they saw themselves apparantly
threatned by the covetous zeal and uncharitable
fury of some men, who think it a great
Argument of the truth of their Religion, to
endure no other but their own.</p>

<p>God knows, as I can with truth wash my
hands in innocency, as to any guilt in that Rebellion;
so I might wash them in my tears, as
to the sad apprehensions I had to see it spread
so far, and make such waste: and this in a
time when distractions and jealousies here in
<i><b>England</b></i> made most men rather intent to their
own safety, or designes they were driving,
then to the relief of those who were every day
inhumanely butchered in Ireland: Whose
tears and bloud might, if nothing else, have
quenched, or at least for a time, repressed and
smothered those sparks of Civill Dissentions
and Jealousies which in England some men
most industriously scattered.</p>

<p>I would to God no man had been less affected
with Irelands' sad estate then my self;
I offered to go my Self in person upon that
Expedition: But some men were either affraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[page 93]</span>
I should have any one Kingdom quieted;
or loth they were to shoot at any mark
here less then my Self; or that any should have
the glory of my destruction but themselves.
Had my many offers been accepted, I am confident,
neither the ruin had been so great, nor the
calamity so long, nor the remedy so desperate.</p>

<p>So that, next to the sin of those who began
that Rebellion, theirs must needs be, who either
hindred the speedy suppressing of it by Domestick
Dissentions, or diverted the Aids, or exasperated
the Rebels to the most desperate resolutions
and actions, by threatning all extremities,
not onely to the known Heads and chiefe
incendiaries, but even to the whole Community
of that Nation; resolving to destroy Root
and Branch, men, women, and children; without
any regard to those usuall pleas for mercy
which Conquerours, not wholly barbarous, are
wont to bear from their own brests, in behalf
of those, whose oppressive faces, rather then
their malice, engaged them; or whose imbecility
for Sex and Age was such, as they could neither
lift up a hand against them, nor distinguish
between their right hand and their left:
Which preposterous (and I think) un-Evangelicall
zeal is too like that of the rebuked Disciples,
who would go no lower in their revenge,
then to call for fire from Heaven upon whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[page 94]</span>
Cities, for the repulse and neglect of a few; or
like that of <i><b>Jacob</b></i>'s sons, which the Father both
blamed and cursed: chusing rather to use all
extreamities, which might drive men to desperate
obstinacy, then to apply moderate remedies;
such as might punish some with exemplary
Justice, yet disarm others, with tenders of
mercy upon their submission, &amp; our protection
of them, from the fury of those, who would
soon drown them, if they refused to swim
down the popular stream with them.</p>

<p>But som kind of Zeal counts all merciful moderation,
luke-warmness; and had rather be
cruel then counted cold, and is not seldom more
greedy to kill the Bear for his skin, then for any
harm he hath done. The confiscation of mens
estates being more beneficiall, then the charity
of saving their lives, or reforming their Errors.</p>

<p>When all proportionable succors of the poor
Protestants in <i><b>Ireland</b></i> (who were daily massacred
and over-born with numbers of now desperate
Enemies) was diverted and obstructed
here; I was earnestly entreated, &amp; generally advised
by the chief of the Protestant party there,
to get them some respite and breathing by a cessation,
without which they saw no probability
(unless by miracle) to preserve the remnant that
had yet escaped: God knows with how much
commiseration and solicitous caution I carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[page 95]</span>
on that business, by persons of Honor and Integrity,
that so I might neither incourage the Rebels
Insolence, nor discourage the Protestants
Loyaltie and Patience.</p>

<p>Yet when this was effected in the best sort,
that the necessity and difficulty of affairs would
then permit, I was then to suffer again in my
Reputation and Honor; because I suffered not
the Rebels utterly to devour the remaining
handfuls of the Protestants there.</p>

<p>I thought that in all reason, the gaining of
that respite could not be so much to the Rebels
advantages (which some have highly calumniated
against me) as it might have been for the
Protestants future, as well as present safety: If
during the time of that Cessation, some men
had the grace to have laid <i><b>Ireland</b></i>'s sad condition
more to heart; &amp; laid aside those violent motions,
which were here carried on by those, that
had better skill to let blood then to stanch it.</p>

<p>But in all the misconstructions of my actions,
(which are prone to find more credulity in men
to what is false, and evil, then love or charity to
what is true and good) as I have no Judge but
God above me, so I can have comfort to appeal
to his omniscience, who doth not therefore deny
my Innocence, because he is pleased so far
to try my patience, as he did his servant <i><b>Job</b></i>'s.</p>

<p>I have enough to do to look to my own Conscience,
and the faithfull discharge of my Trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[page 96]</span>
as a King: I have scarce leisure to consider
those swarms of reproches, which issue out of
some mens mouths &amp; hearts, as easily as smoke,
or sparks do out of a furnace: Much lesse to
make such prolix Apologies, as might give those
men satisfaction: who conscious to their own
depth of wickednesse are loth to beleeve any
man not to be as bad as themselves.</p>

<p>'Tis Kingly to do well, and hear ill: If I can
but act the one, I shall not much regard to
bear the other.</p>

<p>I thank God, I can hear with patience as bad
as my worst enemies can safly say. And I hope
I shall still do better then they desire, or deserve
I should.</p>

<p>I beleeve it will at last appear, that they who
first began to embroil my other Kingdoms, are
in great part guilty, if not of the first letting
out, yet of the not timely stopping those horrid
effusions of bloud in <i><b>Ireland</b></i>.</p>

<p>Which (whatever my Enemies please to say,
or think) I look upon, as that of my other kingdoms,
exhausted out of my own veins: no man
being so much weakened by it as my Self: And
I hope, though mens unsatiable cruelties never
wil, yet the Mercy of God will at length say to
his Justice, <i><b>It is enough</b></i>; and command the sword
of Civil Wars to sheath it self: his mercifull
Justice intending, I trust, not our utter confusion,
but our cure: the abatement of our sins,
not the desolation of these Nations.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>He</b> <i><b>Scots</b></i> are a Nation, upon whom I have
not onely common ties of Nature, Soveraignty,
and Bounty, with My Father of blessed
memory; but also speciall and late obligations
of favours, having gratified the active Spirits
among them so far, that I seemed to many
to prefer the desires of that party, before
My own interest and honor. But, I see, Royall
bountie emboldens some men to ask, and act
beyond all bounds of modesty and gratitude.</p>

<p>My charity, and Act of Pacification, forbids
Me to reflect on former passages, wherin I shal
ever be far from letting any mans ingratitude,
or inconstancy, make me repent of what I
granted them for the publique good: I pray
God it may so prove.</p>

<p>The coming again of that Party into <i><b>England</b></i>,
with an Army only to conforme this
Church to their late New model, cannot but
seem as unreasonable, as they would have
thought the same measure offered from hence
to themselves.</p>

<p>Other errand I could never understand, they
had, (besides those common and vulgar flourishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[page 101]</span>
for Religion and Liberty) save only to
confirme the Presbyterian Copy they had set,
by making this Church to write after them,
though it were in bloudy Characters.</p>

<p>Which design and end, whether it will justifie
the use of such violent means, before the divine
Justice, I leave to their Consciences to
judge, who have already felt the misery of the
means, but not reaped the benefit of the end,
either in this Kingdom, or that.</p>

<p>Such knots and crosseness of grain being
objected here, as will hardly suffer that form
which they cry up, as the only just reformation,
and settling of Government and Discipline in
Churches to go on so smoothly here, as it
might do in <i><b>Scotland</b></i>; and was by them imagined
would have done in <i><b>England</b></i>, when so many
of the <i><b>English</b></i> Clergy, through levity, or
discontent, if no worse passion, suddenly quitted
their former engagements to Episcopacy,
and faced about to their Presbytery.</p>

<p>It cannot but seem either passion, or some
self-seeking, more then true Zeal, and pious
discretion, for any forraign State or Church to
prescribe such medicins only for others, which
themselves have used, rather successefully then
commendably; not considering that the same
Physick on different constitutions, will have
different operations: That may kill one, which
doth but cure another.</p>

<p>Nor do I know any such tough and malignant
humours in the constitution of the <i><b>English</b></i>
Church, which gentler applications then
those of an Army, might not easily have removed:
Nor is it so proper to hew out Religious
Reformations by the sword, as to polish
them by fair &amp; equal disputations among those
that are most concerned in the differences,
whom not force, but reason ought to convince.</p>

<p>But their design now seemed rather to cut
off all disputation here, then to procure a fair
and equal one: For it was concluded there,
That the <i><b>English</b></i> Clergy must conform to the
<i><b>Scots</b></i> pattern before ever they could be heard,
what they could say for themselves, or against
the others way.</p>

<p>I could have wished fairer proceedings both
for their credits, who urge things with such
violence; and for other mens Consciences too;
who can receive litle satisfaction in these points
which are maintained rather by Souldiers
fighting in the Field, then Scholars disputing
in free and learned Synods.</p>

<p>Sure in matters of Religion those truths gain
most on mens Judgments and Consciences,
which are least urged with secular violence,
which weakens truth with prejudices; and is
unreasonable to be used, till such means of rational
conviction hath been applied, as leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[page 103]</span>
no excuse for ignorance, condemns mens obstinacy
to deserved penalties.</p>

<p>Which no charity will easily suspect of so
many learned and pious Church-men in <i><b>England</b></i>;
who being alwaies bred up, and conformable
to the Government of Episcopacy, cannot
so soon renounce both their former opinion &amp;
practice, only because that Party of the <i><b>Scots</b></i>
will needs, by force assist a like Party here, either
to drive all Ministers as sheep, into the
common fold of Presbyterie, or destroy them;
at least fleece them, by depriving them of the benefit
of their Flocks. If the <i>Scotch</i> sole Presbyterie
were approved to be the only Institution
of Jesus Christ, for all Churches Government;
yet I beleeve it would be hard to prove that
Christ had given those <i><b>Scots</b></i>, or any other of my
Subjects, Comission by the Sword, to set it up
in any of my Kingdomes, without my consent.</p>

<p>What respect and obedience Christ and his
Apostles payd to the chief governors of States,
where they lived, is very cleer in the Gospel:
but that he, or they ever commanded to set up
such a parity of Presbyters, and in such a way
as those <i><b>Scots</b></i> endeavour, I think is not very
disputable.</p>

<p>If Presbyterie in such a Supremacy be an institution
of Christ, sure it differs from all others:
and is the first and only point of Christianity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[page 104]</span>
that was to be planted and watered
with so much Christian bloud; whose effusions
run in a stream so contrary to that of the Primitive
planters, both of Christianity and Episcopacy,
which was with patient shedding of
their own bloud, not violently drawing other
mens: sure there is too much of Man in it, to
have much of Christ; none of whose institutions
were carried on, or begun with the temptations
of Covetousness or Ambition, of both
which this is vehemently suspected.</p>

<p>Yet was there never any thing upon the point
which those <i><b>Scots</b></i> had by an Army or Commissioners
to move Me with, by their many
Solemn obtestations, and pious threatnings, but
only this, to represent to me the wonderful necessity
of setting up their Presbytery in <i><b>England</b></i>,
to avoid the further miseries of a War,
which some men chiefly on this design at first
had begun, &amp; now further engaged themselves
to continue.</p>

<p>What hinders that any Sects, Schisms, or Heresies,
if they can get but numbers, strength and
opportunity, may not, according to this opinion
and pattern, set up their wayes by the like
methods of violence? all which Presbitery
seeks to suppresse, &amp; render odious under those
names: when wise &amp; learned men think, that
nothing hath more marks of Schism, and Sectarism,
then this Presbyterian way, both as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[page 105]</span>
Ancient, and still most Universal way of the
Church-government, and especially as to the
particular Laws and Constitutions of this <i><b>English</b></i>
Church, which are not yet repealed, nor
are like to be for me, till I see more Rational
and Religious motives, then Souldiers use to
carry in their Knapsacks.</p>

<p>But we must leave the successe of all to God,
who hath many wayes (having first taken us off
from the folly of our opinions, and fury of our
passion) to teach us those rules of true Reason,
and peaceable Wisdom, which is from above,
tending most to Gods glory, and his Churches
good: which I think my self so much the more
bound in Conscience to attend, with the most
judicious zeal and care, by how much I esteem
the Church above the State, the glory of Christ
above mine Own: and the Salvation of mens
Souls above the preservation of their Bodies
and Estates.</p>

<p>Nor may any men, I think, without sin and
presumption, forcibly endeavour to cast the
Churches under my care and tuition, into the
moulds they have fancied, &amp; fashioned to their
designs, till they have first gained my consent,
and resolved, both mine own and other mens
Consciences by the strength of their Reasons.</p>

<p>Other violent motions, w<sup>ch</sup> are neither Manly,
Christian, nor Loyal, shall never either shake
or settle my Religion, nor any mans else who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[page 106]</span>
knows what Religion means: And how far it
is removed from all Faction, whose proper engine
is force, the arbitrator of beasts, not of reasonable
men, much lesse of humble Christians,
and loyal Subjects, in matters of Religion.</p>

<p>But men are prone to have such high conceits
of themselves, that they care not what cost
they lay <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ont'">out</ins> upon their opinions: especially
those that have some temptation of gain, to recompence
their losses and hazards.</p>

<p>Yet I was not more scandalized at the <i><b>Scots</b></i>
Armies coming in against my will, and their
forfeiture of so many obligations of duty, and
gratitude to me: then I wondred how those
here, could so much distrust Gods assistance,
who so much pretended Gods cause to the people,
as if they had the certainty of some divine
Revelation; considering they were more then
competently furnished with my Subjects Arms
and Ammunition, my Navie by Sea, my Forts,
Castles and Cities by Land.</p>

<p>But I finde that men jealous of the Justificableness
of their doings, and designs before
God, never thinke they have humane strength
enough to carry their work on, seem it never
so plausible to the people; what cannot be
justified in Law and Religion, had need to be
fortified with power.</p>

<p>And yet such is the inconstancy that attends
all minds engaged in violent motion, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[page 107]</span>
whom some of them one while earnestly invite
to come in to their assistance; others of them
soon after are weary of, and with nauseating
cast them out: what one party thought to rivet
to a setlednes by the strength and influence
of the <i><b>Scots</b></i>, that the other rejects and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'contemus'">contemns</ins>;
at once, despising the Kirk-government,
&amp; discipline of the <i><b>Scots</b></i>, and frustrating the
successe of so chargeable, more then charitable
assistance: For, sure the Church of <i><b>England</b></i>
might have purchased at a far cheaper rate, the
Truth &amp; happines of Reformed Government
and Discipline (if it had been wanting) though
it had entertained the best Divines of Christendom
for their advice in a ful &amp; free Synod;
which, I was ever willing to, and desirous of,
that matters being impartially setled, might be
more satisfactory to all, and more durable.</p>

<p>But much of Gods justice, &amp; mans folly will
at length be discovered, through all the filmes
and pretentions of Religion, in which Polititians
wrap up their designes: in vaine do men
hope to build their Piety on the Ruines of loyalty.
Nor can those considerations or designes
be durable, when Subjects make bankrupt of
their Allegiance, under pretence of setting up a
quicker trade for Religion.</p>

<p>But, as my best Subjects of <i><b>Scotland</b></i> never deserted
me, so I cannot think that the most are
gone so far from me, in a prodigality of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[page 108]</span>
love and respects towards me, as to make me
to despair of their return; when besides the
bonds of Nature and Conscience which they
have to me, all Reason and true Policy will
teach them, That their chiefest interest consists
in their fidelity to the Crown, not in their serviceableness
to any Party of the People, to a
neglect and betraying of my Safety and Honor
for their own advantages: However the lesse
cause I have to trust to men, the more I shall
apply my Self to God.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>He</b> <i><b>Presbyterian Scots</b></i> are not to be hired
at the ordinary rate of Auxiliaries; nothing
will induce them to engage, till those that call
them in, have pawned their Souls to them, by a
Solemn League and Covenant.</p>

<p>Where many engines of religious and fair
pretensions are brought chiefly to batter or rase
Episcopacy: This they make the grand evil Spirit,
which with other Imps purposely added, to
make it more odious, &amp; terrible to the Vulgar,
must by so solemn a charm &amp; exorcism be cast
out of this Church, after more then a thousand
years possession here, from the first plantation
of Christianity in this Island, and an universal
prescription of time and practice in all other
Churches since the Apostles times till this last
Century.</p>

<p>But no Antiquity must plead for it; Presbytery
like a young Heir, thinks the Father hath
lived long enough, &amp; impatient not to be in the
Bishops chair and authority (though Lay-men
go away with the Revenus) all art is used to
sink Episcopacy, and lanch Presbytery in <i><b>England</b></i>;
which was lately boyed up in <i><b>Scotland</b></i>
by the late artifice of a Covenant.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[page 111]</span>

<p>Although I am unsatisfied with many passages
in that Covenant some referring to my
self with very dubious and dangerous limitations
(yet I chiefly wonder at the design and
drift touching the Discipline and Government
of the Church); and such a manner of carrying
them on to new ways, by Oaths and Covenants,
where it is hard for men to be engaged
by no less, then swearing for, or against
those things, which are of no clear morall
necessity, but very disputable, and controverted
among learned and godly men: whereto
the application of Oaths can hardly be made
and enjoyned with that judgment and certainty
in ones self, or that charity or candour
to others of different opinion, as I think religion
requires, which never refuses fair and
equable deliberations; yea, and dissentings
too, in matters only probable.</p>

<p>The enjoyning of Oaths upon People must
needs in things doubtfull be dangerous, as in
things unlawfull, damnable; and no lesse superfluous,
where former Religious and Legal
Engagements, bound men sufficiently, to all
necessary duties. Nor can I see how they will
reconcile such an Innovating Oath and Covenant,
with their former Protestation which
was so lately taken, to maintain the Religion
established in the Church of <i><b>England</b></i>; since
they count Discipline so great a part of Religion.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[page 112]</span>

<p>But ambitious minds never think they have
laid snares and ginnes enough to catch and
hold the vulgar credulity: for by such politicke
and seemingly pious stratagems, they
think to keep the popularity fast to their Parties
under the terrour of perjury: Whereas certainly
all honest and wise men ever thought
themselves sufficiently bound by former ties
of Religion, Allegiance, and lawes, to God
and man.</p>

<p>Nor can such after-contracts, devised and
imposed by a few men in a declared Party,
without my consent, and without any like
power or president from Gods or mans laws,
be ever thought by judicious men sufficient either
to obsolve or slacked those moral and eternall
bonds of duty which lie upon all My
Subjects consciences both to God and me.</p>

<p>Yet as things now stand, good men shall
least offend God or Me, by keeping their
Covenant in honest and lawfull wayes; since I
have the charity to think, that the chief end of
the Covenant in such mens intentions, was, to
preserve Religion in purity, and the Kingdoms
in peace: To other then such ends and
meanes they cannot think themselves engaged;
nor will those, that have any true touches
of Conscience endeavour to carry on the best
designes, (much lesse such as are, and will be
daily more apparently factious and ambitious)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[page 113]</span>
by any unlawfull means, under that title of
the Covenant: unlesse they dare preferre ambiguous,
dangerous and un-authorized novelties,
before their known and sworn duties,
which are indespensable, both to God and my
self.</p>

<p>I am prone to beleeve and hope, That many
who took the Covenant, are yet firme to this
judgment, That such latter Vowes, Oaths, or
Leagues, can never blot out those former gravings,
and characters, which by just and lawfull
Oaths were made upon their Souls.</p>

<p>That which makes such Confederations by
way of Solemn Leagues and Covenants more
to be suspected, is, That they are the common
road, used in all factious and powerfull perturbations
of State or Church: when formalities
of extraordinary zeal and piety are never more
studied and elaborate, then, when Polititians
most agitate desperate designes against all that
is setled, or sacred in Religion, and Laws, which
by such scrues are cunningly, yet forcibly
wrested by secret steps, and lesse sencible degrees,
from their known rule and wonted practise,
and comply with the humours of those
men, who ayme to subdue all to their own
will and power, under the disguises of Holy
Combinations.</p>

<p>Which cords and wythes will hold mens
Consciences no longer, then force attends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[page 114]</span>
and twists them: for every man soon grows
his own Pope, and easily absolves himself of
those ties, which, not the commands of Gods
Word, or the Laws of the Land, but only
the subtilty and terrour of a Party casts upon
him; either superfluous and vain, when
they were sufficiently tied before; or fraudulent
and injurious, if by such afterligaments
they find the Imposers really ayming to dissolve,
or suspend their former just and necessary
obligations.</p>

<p>Indeed such illegall ways seldom or never
intend the engaging men more to duties, but
only to Parties; therefore it is not regarded
how they keep their Covenants in point of
piety pretended, provided they adhere firmly
to the Party and Design intended.</p>

<p>I see the Imposers of it are content to
make their Covenant like Manna (not that
it came from Heaven, as this did) agreeable
to every mans palate and rellish, who will
but swallow it: They admit any mens senses
of it, the divers or contrary; with any
salvoes, cautions and reservations, so as they
cross not their chief Design, which is laid
against the Church and me.</p>

<p>It is enough if they get but the reputation
of a seeming encrease to their Party; so little
do men remember that God is not mocked.</p>

<p>In such latitudes of sense, <i>I</i> beleive many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[page 115]</span>
that love Me, and the Church well, may have
taken the Covenant, who yet are not so fondly
and superstitiously taken by it, as now to
act cleerly against both all piety &amp; loyalty: who
first yeelded to it, more to prevent that imminent
violence and ruine, which hung over their
heads in case they wholly refused it, then for any
value of it, or devotion to it.</p>

<p>Wherein, the latitude of some generall
Clauses may (perhaps) serve somewhat to
relieve them, as of <i><b>Doing and endeavouring
what lawfully they may, in their Places and
Callings</b></i>, and <i><b>according to the Word of God</b></i>: for
these (indeed) carry no man beyond those
bounds of good Conscience, which are certain &amp;
fixed either in Gods Laws, as to the Generall;
or the Laws of the State and Kingdom, as to
the particular regulation and exercise of mens
duties.</p>

<p>I would to God such as glory most in the
name of <i><b>Covenanters</b></i>, would keep themselves
within those lawfull bounds, to which God
hath called them: surely it were the best way
to expiate the rashnesse of taking it; which
must needs then appear, when besides the
want of a full and lawfull Authority at first
to enjoyn it, it shall actually be carried on
beyond and against those ends which were in
it specified and pretended. I willingly forgive
such mens taking the Covenant, who keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[page 116]</span>
it within such bounds of Piety, Law, and Loyaltie,
as can never hurt either the Church, My
self, or the Publick Peace: Against which, no
mans lawfull Calling can engage him.</p>

<p>As for that Reformation of the Church
which the Covenant pretends, I cannot think
it just or comely, that by the partiall advice of
a few Divines, (of so soft and servile tempers,
as disposed them to so sudden acting and compliance,
contrary to their former judgements,
profession, and practise) such foule scandalls
and suspitions should be cast upon the Doctrine
and Government of the Church of
<i><b>England</b></i>, as was never done (that I have heard)
by any that deserved the name of <i><b>Reformed
Churches</b></i> abroad, nor by any men of learning
and candour at home: all whose judgments <i>I</i>
cannot but prefer before any mens now factiously
engaged.</p>

<p>No man can be more forward then My self
to carry on all due Reformations, which mature
judgment, and a good Conscience, in
what things I shall (after impartiall advise) be,
by Gods Word, and right reason, convinced
to be amiss, I have offered more than ever the
fullest, freest, and wisest Parliaments did
desire.</p>

<p>But the sequele of some mens actions makes
it evident, that the maine information intended,
is the abasing of Episcopacy into Presbytery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[page 117]</span>
and the robbing of the Church of its
Lands and Revenues: For, no men have been
more injuriously used, as to their legall Rights
then the Bishops, and Church-men. These,
as the fattest Dear, must be destroyed; the
other Rascal herd of Schismes, Heresies, &amp;c.
being leane, may enjoy the benefit of a Toleration:
Thus <i><b>Naboth</b></i>'s Vine-yard made him
the onely Blasphemer of his City, and fit to
die. Still I see: while the breath of Religion
fills the Sailes, Profit is the compasse, by which
Factious men steer their course in all seditious
Commotions.</p>

<p>I thank God, as no man lay more open to
the sacrilegious temptation of usurping the
Churches Lands, and Revenues, (which issuing
chiefly from the Crown, are held of it,
and legally can revert onely to the Crowne
with my Consent) so I have alwayes had such
a perfect abhorrence of it in my Soule, that I
never found the least inclination to such sacrilegious
Reformings: yet no man hath a greater
desire to have Bishops and all Church-men,
so reformed, that they may best deserve and
use, not onely what the pious munificence of
My Predecessours hath given to God and the
Church, but all other additions of Christian
bounty.</p>

<p>But no necessity shall ever, I hope, drive me
or Mine to invade or sell the Priests Lands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[page 118]</span>
which both <i><b>Pharaoh's</b></i> divinity, and <i><b>Joseph's</b></i>
true piety abhorred to do: So unjust I think
it both in the eye of Reason and Religion, to
deprive the most sacred employment of all
due incouragements; and like that other hard-hearted
<i><b>Pharaoh</b></i>, to withdraw the Straw, and
encrease the Task; so pursuing the oppressed
Church as some have done, to the red Sea of
a Civill War, where nothing but a miracle can
save either it, or him, who esteems it his greatest
Title to be called, and his chiefest glory to
be <i><b>The defender of the Church, both in its
true faith, and its just fruitions; equally abhoring
Sacriledge and Apostacy</b></i>.</p>

<p>I had rather live as my Predecessour <i><b>Henry</b></i>
the 3. sometime did, on the Churches alms,
then violently to take the bread out of Bishops
and Ministers mouths.</p>

<p>The next work will be <i><b>Jeroboam's</b></i> reformation,
consecrating the meanest of the people
to be Priests in <i><b>Israel</b></i>, to serve those Golden
<i><b>Calves</b></i> who have enrich'd themselves with the
Churches Patrimony and Dowry; which how
it thrived both with Prince, Priests and people,
is well enough known: And so it will be
here, when from the tuition of Kings and
Queens, which have been nursing fathers and
mothers of this Church, it will be at their allowance,
who have already discovered, what
hard fathers and step-mothers they will be.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[page 119]</span>

<p>If the poverty of <i><b>Scotland</b></i> might, yet the
plenty of <i><b>England</b></i> cannot excuse the envy
and rapine of the Churches Rights and Revenues.</p>

<p>I cannot so much as pray God to prevent
those sad consequences, which will inevitably
follow the parity and poverty of Ministers,
both in Church and State; since I think
it no lesse then a mocking and tempting of
God, to desire him to hinder those mischiefs
whose occasions and remedies are in our own
power; it being every mans sin not to avoid the
one, and not to use the other.</p>

<p>There are ways enough to repair the breaches
of the State without the ruins of the
Church; as I would be a restorer of the one, so
I would not be an oppressor of the other under
the pretence of publick Debts: The occasions
contracting them were bad enough, but
such a discharging of them would be much
worse; I pray God neither I, nor mine, may
be accessary to either.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">I</span>
<b>F</b> <i>I</i> had not My own Innocency, and Gods
protection, it were hard for Me to stand
out against those stratagems and conflicts of
malice, which by falsities seek to oppresse the
Truth; and by Jealousies to supply the defect
of reall causes, which might seem to justifie so
unjust ingagements against Me.</p>

<p>And indeed, the worst effects of open hostility
come short of these designes: For, <i>I</i> can
more willingly lose My Crownes, then My
credit; nor are My Kingdomes so dear to Me,
as My Reputation and Honor.</p>

<p>Those must have a period with my life; but
these may survive to a glorious kind of Immortality,
when I am dead and gone: A good
name being the imbalming of Princes, and a
sweet consecrating of them to an Eternity of
love and gratitude among Posterity.</p>

<p>Those foul and false aspersions were secret
engines at first employed against My peoples
love to Me: that undermining their opinion
and value of Me, My enemies, and theirs too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[page 123]</span>
might at one blow up their affections, and
batter down their loyalty.</p>

<p>Wherein yet, I thank God, the detriment
of My Honor is not so afflictive to Me, as the
sin and danger of My peoples souls, whose
eyes once blinded with such mists of suspicions,
they are soon misled into the most desperate
precipices of actions: wherein they do
not only, not consider their sin and danger,
but glory in their zealous adventures; while I
am rendred to them so fit to be destroyed, that
many are ambitious to merit the name of My
Destroyers; Imagining they then fear God
most, when they least honor their King.</p>

<p>I thank God, I never found but My pity
was above My anger; nor have My passions
ever so prevailed against me, as to exclude My
most compassionate prayers for them, whom
devout errours more then their own malice
have betrayed to a most religious Rebellion.</p>

<p>I had the Charity to interpret, that most
part of My Subjects fought against My supposed
Errours, not My person; and intended
to mend Me, not to end Me: And <i>I</i> hope that
God pardoning their Errours, hath so farre
accepted and answered their good intentions,
as he hath yet preserved Me, so he
hath by these afflictions prepared me, both to
do him better service, and My people more
good then hitherto I have done.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[page 124]</span>

<p>I do not more willingly forgive their seductions,
which occasioned their loyall injuries,
then I am ambitious by all Princely merits
to redeem them from their unjust suspicions,
and reward them for their good intentions.</p>

<p>I am too conscious to My own affections
toward the generality of my people to suspect
theirs to Me; nor shall the malice of My Enemies
ever be able to deprive Me of the comfort
which that confidence gives Me; I shall
never gratifie the spightfulnesse of a few with
any sinister thoughts of all their Allegiance,
whom pious frauds have seduced.</p>

<p>The worst some mens ambition can do, shall
never perswade Me, to make so bad interpretations
of most of My Subjects actions; who
possibly may be erroneous, but not Hereticall
in point of Loyalty.</p>

<p>The sence of the injuries done to My Subjects
is as sharp, as those done to My Self;
our welfares being inseparable; in this only
they suffer more then My self, that they are
animated by some seducers to injure at once
both themselves and Me.</p>

<p>For this it is not enough to the malice of My
Enemies, that I be afflicted; but it must be
done by such instruments, that My afflictions
grieve Me not more, then this doth, that I am
afflicted by those, whose prosperity I earnestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[page 125]</span>
desire, and whose seduction I heartily
deplore.</p>

<p>If they had been my open and forraign
Enemies, I could have born it; but they must
be My own Subjects, who are next to My
Children dear to me: And for the restoring
of some tranquillity, I could willingly be the
<i>Jonah</i>, if I did not evidently fore-see, that
by the divided interests of their and Mine Enemies,
as by contrary winds, the storm of
their miseries would be rather increased then
allayed.</p>

<p>I had rather prevent my peoples ruin then
rule over them; nor am I so ambitious of
that Dominion which is but My Right, as of
their happiness; If it could expiate or countervail
such a way of obtaining it, by the highest
injuries of subjects committed against their
Soveraign.</p>

<p>Yet I had rather suffer all the miseries of
life, and die many deaths, then shamefully to
desert, or dishonourable to betray My own
just Rights and Soveraignty; thereby to gratifie
the ambition, or justifie the malice of my
enemies; between whose malice, and other
mens mistakes, I put as great a difference, as
between an ordinary Ague and the Plague;
or the Itch of Novelty, and the Leprosie of
Disloyalty.</p>

<p>As Liars need have good memories, so malicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[page 126]</span>
persons need good inventions; that
their calumnies may fit every mans fancy; and
what their reproaches want of truth, they may
make up with numbers and shew.</p>

<p>My patience (I thank God) wil better serve
Me to bear, and My charity to forgive, then
My leisure to answer the many false Aspersions
which some men have cast upon Me.</p>

<p>Did I not more consider My Subjects Satisfaction,
then my owne Vindication, I should
never have given the malice of some men that
pleasure, as to see me take notice of, or remember
what they say, or object.</p>

<p>I would leave the Authors to be punished
by their own evill manners, and seared Consciences,
which will, I believe, in a shorter
time then they be aware of, both confute and
revenge all those black and false Scandals
which they have cast on me; And make the
world see, there is as little truth in them, as
there was little worth in the broaching of
them, or Civility, (I need not say Loyalty) in
the not suppressing of them; whose credit and
reputation, even with the people, shall ere long
be quite blasted by the breath of that same
fornace of popular obloquy, and detraction,
which they have studied to heat and inflame to
the highest degree of infamy, and wherein
they have sought to cast and consume My
Name and Honor.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[page 127]</span>

<p>First, nothing gave me more cause to suspect,
and search mine own innocencie, then
when I observed so many forward to engage
against me, who had made great professions
of singular piety; For this gave to Vulgar
minds so bad a reflection upon me and my
Cause, as if it had been impossible to adhere
to me, and not withall part from God; to
think or speak well of me, and not to blaspheme
him; so many were perswaded that
these two were utterly inconsistent, to be at
once Loyall to Me, and truly Religious toward
God.</p>

<p>Not but that I had (I thank God) many
with me, which were both learned and Religious,
(much above that ordinary size, and
that Vulgar proportion wherein some men
glory so much) who were so well satisfied in
the cause of my sufferings, that they chose rather
to suffer with me, then forsake me.</p>

<p>Nor is it strange, that so religious Pretensions
as were used against me, should be to
many well-minded men a great temptation to
oppose me; especially, being urged by such
popular Preachers as think it no sin to lie for
God, and what they please to call Gods
Cause, cursing all that will not curse with
them; looking so much at, and crying up the
goodnesse of the end propounded, that they
consider not the lawfulness of the means used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[page 128]</span>
nor the depth of the mischief, chiefly plotted
and intended.</p>

<p>The weakness of these mens judgments must
be made up by their clamours and activity.</p>

<p>It was a great part of some mens Religion to
scandalize me and mine; they thought theirs
could not be true, if they cried not down
Mine as false.</p>

<p>I thank God, I have had more triall of his
grace, as to the constancy of my Religion in
the Protestant profession of the Church of
<i><b>England</b></i>, both abroad, and at home, then ever
they are like to have.</p>

<p>Nor do <i>I</i> know any exception I am so liable
to, in their opinion, as too great a fixedness
in that Religion, whose judicious and
solid grounds, both from Scripture, and Antiquity,
will not give my conscience leave to
approve or consent to those many dangerous
and divided innovations, which the bold ignorance
of some men would needs obtrude
upon me, and my people.</p>

<p>Contrary to those well tried foundations
both of Truth, and Order, which men of far
greater Learning, and clearer Zeal, have settled
in the Confession and Constitution of this
Church in <i><b>England</b></i>, which many former
Parliaments in the most calm, and unpassionate
times, have oft confirmed; In which
I shall ever, by Gods help, persevere, as beleeving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[page 129]</span>
it hath most of primitive Truth and
Order.</p>

<p>Nor did my using the assistance of some Papists,
which were my Subjects, any way fight
against my Religion, some men would needs
interpret it: especially those who least of all
men cared whom they imployed, or what they
said and did, so they might prevail.</p>

<p>'Tis strange that so wise men, as they would
be esteemed, should not conceive, That differences
of perswasion in matters of Religion
may easily fall out, where there is the samenesse
of duty, Allegeance and subjection: The first
they owe as men and Christians to God; the
second they owe to me in common, as their
<span class="sc">King</span>: different professions in point of Religion
cannot (any more then in civill Trades)
take away the community of relations either
to Parents, or to Princes. And where is there
such an <i>Oglio</i> or medly of various Religions
in the world again, as those men entertain in
their service (who finde most fault with me)
without any scruple, as to the diversity of their
Sects and Opinions!</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a foul and indeleable shame,
for such as would be counted Protestants, to
inforce Me, a declared Protestant, their Lord
and King, to a necessary use of Papists, or any
other, who did but their duty to help Me to
defend my self.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[page 130]</span>

<p>Nor did I more then is lawful for any King,
in such exigents to use the aid of any his Subjects.</p>

<p>I am sorry the Papists should have a greater
sense of their Allegeance then many Protestant
Professors; who seem to have learned,
and to practise the worst Principles of the
worst Papists.</p>

<p>Indeed, it had been a very impertinent and
unseasonable scruple in me, (and very pleading,
no doubt to my Enemies) to have been
then disputing the points of different beliefs
in my Subjects, when I was disputed with by
Swords points: and when I needed the help
of my Subjects as men, no lesse then their prayers
as Christians.</p>

<p>The noise of my evill Counsellours was another
usefull device for those, who were impatient
any mens counsels but their own
should be followed in Church or State; who
were so eager in giving me better counsel, that
they would not give me leave to take it with
freedom, as a Man; or honour, as a King;
making their Counsels more like a drench, that
must be powred down, then a draught, which
might be fairly and leisurely drank, if I liked
it.</p>

<p>I will not justifie beyond humane errour
and frailties my Self, or my Counsellours:
They might be subject to some miscarriages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[page 131]</span>
yet such as were far more reparable by second
and better thoughts, then those enormous
extravagances wherewith some men have
now even wildred, and almost quite lost both
Church and State.</p>

<p>The event of things at last will make it evident
to my Subjects, that had I followed the
worst Counsels that my worst Counsellours
ever had the boldnesse to offer to me, or my
Self any inclination to use; I could not so
soon have brought both Church and State
in three flourishing Kingdoms, to such a
<i>Chaos</i> of confusion, and hell of miseries as
some have done; out of which they cannot,
or will not, in the midst of their many great
advantages, redeem either Me, or my Subjects.</p>

<p>No men were more willing to complain,
then I was to redresse what I saw in reason
was either done or advised amisse: and this I
thought I had done, even beyond the expectation
of moderate men: who were sorry to see
me prone even to injure my Self, out of a zeal
to relieve my Subjects.</p>

<p>But other mens insatiable desire of revenge
upon Me, my Court, and my Clergie, hath
wholly beguiled both Church and State of
the benefit of all my either Retractations or
Concessions; and withall, hath deprived all
those (now so zealous Persecutors) both of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[page 132]</span>
comfort and reward of their former pretended
Persecutions, wherein they so much gloryed
among the Vulgar; and which, indeed a truly
humbly Christian will so highly prize, as rather
not be relieved, then be revenged, so as
to be bereaved of that Crown of Christian
patience, which attends humble and injured
sufferers.</p>

<p>Another artifice used to withdraw my peoples
affections from me to their designes, was,
the noise and ostentation of Liberty, which
men are not more prone to desire, then unapt
to bear in the popular sense; which is to doe
what every man liketh best.</p>

<p>If the divinest Liberty be to will what men
should, and to do what they so will, according
to Reason, Laws and Religion; I envie not
my Subjects that liberty, which is all I desire
to enjoy my self; So far am I from the desire
of oppressing theirs. Now were those Lords
and Gentlemen which assisted me, so prodigal
of their Liberties, as with their Lives and Fortunes
to help on the enslaving of themselves
and their Posterities?</p>

<p>As to Civil Immunities, none but such as
desire to drive on their ambitious and covetous
Designes over the ruines of Church and
State, Prince, Peers, and People, will ever
desire greater Freedoms than the Laws allow;
whose bounds good men count their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[page 133]</span>
Ornament and Protection; others their Manacles
and Oppression.</p>

<p>Nor is it just any man should expect the
reward and benefit of the Law, who despiseth
his rule and direction, losing justly his
Safety, while he seeks an unreasonable Libertie.</p>

<p>Time will best inform my Subjects, that
those are the best preservers of their true Liberties,
who allow themselves the least licentiousnesse
against or beyond the Laws.</p>

<p>They will feel it at last to their cost, that it
is impossible those men should be really tender
of their fellow-subjects liberties, who have
the hardinesse to use their King with so severe
restraints, against all Laws, both Divine and
Humane; under which yet I wil rather perish,
then complain to those, who want nothing
to compleat their mirth and triumph, but such
musick.</p>

<p>In point of true conscientious tendernesse
(attended with humility and meeknesse, not
with proud and arrogant activity, which seeks
to hatch every egg of different opinion to a
Faction or Schism) I have oft declared, how
little I desire my Laws and Scepter should
intrench on Gods Soveraignty, which is the
onely King of mens Consciences; and yet he
hath laid such restraints upon men, as commands
them to be subject for conscience sake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[page 134]</span>
giving no men liberty to break the Law established,
further then with meeknesse and patience
they are content to suffer the penalty
annexed, rather then perturb the publick
Peace.</p>

<p>The truth is, some mens thirst after Novelties,
others despair to relieve the necessities of
their Fortunes, or satisfie their Ambition in
peaceable times, (distrusting Gods providence,
as well as their own merits) were the
secret (but principal) impulsives to these popular
Commotions, by which Subjects have
been perswaded to expend much of those
plentifull Estates they got, and enjoyed under
my Government in peaceable times; which
yet must now be blasted with all the odious
reproaches which impotent malice can invent;
and my Self exposed to all those contempts,
which may most diminish the Majesty
of a King, and increase the ingratefull insolencies
of my People.</p>

<p>For mine Honour, I am well assured, that
as mine Innocency is clear before God, in
point of any calumnies they object; so my Reputation
shall like the Sun (after Owls and
Bats have had their freedom in the night and
darker times) rise and recover it self to such a
degree of splendour, as those ferall Birds
shall be grieved to behold, and unable to bear.
For never were any Princes more glorious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[page 135]</span>
then those whom God hath suffered to be tried
in the fournace of afflictions, by their injurious
Subjects.</p>

<p>And who knows but the just and mercifull
God will do me good, for some mens hard,
false, and evill speeches against Me; wherein
they speak rather what they wish, then what
they beleeve, or know.</p>

<p>Nor can I suffer so much in point of Honour,
by those rude and scandalous Pamphlets
(which like fire in great conflagrations, fly up
and down to set all places on like flames)
as those men do, who pretending to so
much piety, are so forgetfull of their duty to
God and Me: By no way ever vindicating
the Majesty of their <span class="sc">King</span> against any of
those, who contrary to the precept of God,
and precedent of Angels, <i><b>speak evil of dignities,
and bring railing accusations against those</b></i>
who are honoured with the name of <i><b>Gods.</b></i></p>

<p>But 'tis no wonder if men not fearing God,
should not honour their <span class="sc">King</span>.</p>

<p>They will easily contemn such shadows of
God, who reverence not that Supreme and
adorable Majestie, in comparison of whom all
the glory of Men and Angels is but obscurity;
yet hath he graven such Characters of divine
Authority, and sacred Power upon Kings, as
none may without sin seek to blot them out.
Nor shall their black veils be able to hide the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[page 136]</span>
shining of my face, while God gives me an
heart frequently and humbly to converse with
him, from whom alone are all the traditions
of true glory and majestie.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">16. <i>Upon the Ordinance against the Common-Prayer Book.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">I</span>
<b>T</b> is no newes to have all Innovations ushered
in with the name of Reformations in
Church and State, by those, who seeking to
gain reputation with the Vulgar for their extraordinary
parts, and piety, must needs undoe
what ever was formerly setled never so
well and wisely.</p>

<p>So hardly can the pride of those that study
Novelties, allow former times any share or
degree of wisedom or godliness.</p>

<p>And because matter of prayer and devotion
to God justly bears a great part in Religion,
(being the soules more immediate converse
with the divine Majesty) nothing could be
more plausible to the people then to tell them,
they served God amiss in that point.</p>

<p>Hence our publike Liturgy, or Forms of
constant Prayers must be (not amended, in
what upon free and publick advice might
seem to sober men inconvenient for matter or
manner, to which I should easily consent, but)
wholly cashiered, and abolished, and after many
popular contempts offered to the Booke,
and those that used it according to their consciences,
and the Lawes in force, it must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[page 139]</span>
crucified by an Ordinance the better to please
either those men, who gloried in their extemporary
veine and fluency: or others, who
conscious to their own formality in the use
of it, thought they fully expiated their sin of
not using it aright, by laying all the blame upon
it, and a totall rejection of it as a dead letter,
thereby to excuse the deadness of their hearts.</p>

<p>As for the matter contained in the Book,
sober and learned men have sufficiently vindicated
it against the cavils and exceptions of
those who thought it a part of piety to make
what profane objections they could against it;
especially for Popery and Superstition; whereas
no doubt the Liturgy was exactly conformed
to the doctrine of the Church of <i><b>England</b></i>; &amp;
this by all Reformed Churches is confessed to
be most sound and Orthodox.</p>

<p>For the manner of using set and prescribed
Forms, there is no doubt but that wholsome
words being known and fitted to mens understandings,
are soonest received into their
hearts, and aptest to excite and carry along
with them judicious and fervent affections.</p>

<p>Nor doe I see any reason why Christians
should be weary of a well-composed Liturgie
(as I hold this to be) more then of all other
things, wherein the constancy abates nothing
of the excellency and usefulness.</p>

<p>I could never see any Reason, why any Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[page 140]</span>
should abhor, or be forbidden to use the
same Forms of prayer, since he prayes to the
same God, believes in the same Saviour, professeth
the same Truths, reads the same Scriptures,
hath the same duties upon him, and
feels the same daily wants for the most part,
both inward and outward, which are common
to the whole Church.</p>

<p>Sure we may as well beforehand know what
we pray, as to whom we pray; and in what
word, as to what sense; when we desire the
same things, what hinders we may not use the
same words? our appetite and digestion too
may be good, when we use, as we pray for, <i><b>our
daily bread</b></i>.</p>

<p>Some men, I hear, are so impatient not to
use in all their devotions their own invention
and gifts, that they not only disuse (as too
many) but wholly cast away and contemn the
<i><b>Lords Prayer</b></i>: whose great guilt is, that it is
the warrant and originall patern of all set Liturgies
in the Christian Church.</p>

<p>I ever thought that the proud ostentation
of mens abilities for invention, and the vain
affectation of variety for expressions, in publike
prayer, or any sacred administrations,
merits a greater brand of sin, then that which
they call coldness and Barrenness: Nor are
men in those novelties less subject to formall
and superficiall tempers, (as to their hearts)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[page 141]</span>
then in the use of constant Forms, where not
the words, but mens hearts are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'too'">to</ins> blame.</p>

<p>I make no doubt but a man may be very formall
in the most extemporary variety; &amp; very
fervently devout in the most wonted expressions:
Nor is God more a God of variety,
than of constancy: Nor are constant Forms
of prayers more likely to flat, and hinder the
Spirit of Prayer and Devotion, than an unpremeditated
and confused variety, to distract
and lose it.</p>

<p>Though I am not against a grave, modest,
discreet, and humble use of Ministers gifts,
even in publique, the better to fit, and excite
their owne, and the peoples affections to the
present occasions: yet I know no necessity
why private and single abilities should quite
justle out, &amp; deprive the Church of the joynt
abilities and concurrent gifts of many learned
and godly men; such as the Composers of
the Service-Book were; who may in all reason
be thought to have more of gifts &amp; graces
enabling them to compose with serious
deliberation &amp; concurrent advice, such Forms
of prayers, as may best fit the Churches common
wants, inform the Hearers understanding,
and stir up that fiduciary and fervent
application of their spirits (wherein consists
the very life and soul of prayer, and that so
much pretended Spirit of prayer) then any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[page 142]</span>
private man by his solitary abilities, can be
presumed to have; which, what they are many
times (even there, where they make a great
noise and shew) the affectations, emptinesse,
impertinency, rudenesse, confusions, flatnesse,
levity, obscurity, vain and ridiculous repetitions,
the senslesse, and oft-times blasphemous
expressions; all these burthened with a most
tedious and intolerable length, do sufficiently
convince all men, but those who glory in that
Pharisaick way.</p>

<p>Wherein men must be strangely impudent,
and flatterers of themselves, not to have an
infinite shame of what they do and say, in
things of so sacred a nature, before God and
the Church, after so ridiculous, and indeed,
profane a manner.</p>

<p>Nor can it be expected, but that in duties of
frequent performance, as Sacramentall administrations,
and the like, which are still the
same; Ministers must either come to use their
own Forms constantly, which are not like to
be so sound, or comprehensive of the nature
of the duty, as forms of publike composure;
or else they must every time affect new expressions
when the subject is the same; which can
hardly be presumed in any mans greatest sufficiencies
not to want (many times) much of
that compleatnesse, order, and gravity, becoming
those duties; which by this meanes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[page 143]</span>
are exposed at every celebration to every Ministers
private infirmities, indispositions, errours,
disorders, and defects, both for judgement
and expression.</p>

<p>A serious sense of which inconvenience in
the Church unavoidably following every
mans severall manner of officiating, no doubt,
first occasioned the wisdome and piety of the
Ancient Churches, to remedy those mischiefs,
by the use of constant Liturgies of publike
composure.</p>

<p>The want of which I believe this Church
will sufficiently feel, when the unhappy fruits
of many mens ungoverned ignorance, and
confident defects, shall be discovered in more
errours, schismes, disorders, and uncharitable
distractions in Religion, which are already but
too many, and the more is the pitie.</p>

<p>However, if violence must needs bring in
and abet those innovations, (that men may
not seem to have nothing to do) which Law,
Reason, and Religion forbids, at least to be so
obtruded, as wholly to justle out the publike
Liturgy;</p>

<p>Yet nothing can excuse that most unjust
and partiall severity of those men, who either
lately had subscribed to, used and maintained
the Service-book; or refused to use it,
cried out of the rigour of Laws and Bishops,
which suffered them not to use the Liberty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[page 144]</span>
their Consciences in not using it.</p>

<p>That these men, (I say) should so suddenly
change the Liturgy into a Directory, as if the
Spirit needed help for invention, though not
for expressions; or as if matter prescribed did
not as much stint and obstruct the Spirit, as if
it were cloathed in, and confined to fit words
(so slight &amp; easie is that Legerdemain which
will serve to delude the vulgar.)</p>

<p>That further, they should <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'nse'">use</ins> such severity as
not to suffer without penalty, any to use the
Common-Prayer-Book publikely, although
their consciences bind them to it, as a duty of
Piety to God, and Obedience to the Laws.</p>

<p>Thus I see, no men are prone to be greater
Tyrants, and more rigorous exactors upon
others to conform to their illegall novelties,
then such, whose pride was formerly least disposed
to the obedience of lawfull Constitutions;
and whose licentious humours most
pretended consciencious liberties, which freedome,
with much regret, they now allow to
Me, and My Chaplains, when they may have
leave to serve Me, whose abilities, even in their
extemporary way comes not short of the others,
but their modesty and learning far exceeds
the most of them.</p>

<p>But this matter is of so popular a nature, as
some men knew it would not bear learned and
sober debates, lest being convinced by the evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[page 145]</span>
of Reason, as well as Laws, they should
have been driven either to sin more against
their knowledge, by taking away the Liturgie;
or to displease some faction of the people, by
continuing the use of it.</p>

<p>Though, I beleeve, they have offended more
considerable men, not onely for their numbers
and estates, but for their weighty and judicious
piety, then those are, whose weaknesse
or giddinesse they sought to gratifie by taking
it away.</p>

<p>One of the greatest faults some men found
with the Common-Prayer-Book, I beleeve,
was this, That it taught them to pray so oft
for Me; to which Petitions they had not
Loyaltie enough to say <i><b>Amen</b></i>, nor yet Charitie
enough to forbear Reproaches, and even Cursings
of Me in their own Forms, in stead of
praying for Me.</p>

<p>I wish their repentance may be their onely
punishment; that seeing the mischiefs, which
the disuse of publick Liturgies hath already
produced, they may restore that credit, use and
reverence to them, which by the ancient Churches
were given to set Forms of sound and
wholsom words.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>Ouching</b> the Government of the Church
by Bishops, the common Jealousie hath
been, that I am earnest and resolute to maintain
it, not so much out of pietie, as policie,
and reason of State.</p>

<p>Wherein so far indeed reason of State doth
induce me to approve that Government above
any other, as I find it impossible for a
Prince to preserve the State in quiet, unlesse
he hath such an influence upon Church-men,
and they such a dependance on Him, as may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[page 148]</span>
best restraine the seditious exorbitancies of
Ministers tongues; who with the Keyes of
Heaven have so far the Keyes of the Peoples
hearts, as they prevail much by their Oratory
to let in, or shut out, both Peace and Loyalty.</p>

<p>So that I being (as King) intrusted by God,
and the Lawes, with the good both of Church
and State; I see no Reason I should give up,
or weaken by any change, that power and influence
which in right and reason I ought to
have over both.</p>

<p>The moving Bishops out of the House of
Peers (of which I have elswhere given an account)
was sufficient to take off any suspicion,
that I inclined to them for any use to be made
of their Votes in State affaires: Though indeed
I never thought any Bishop worthy to
sit in that House, who would not Vote according
to his Conscience.</p>

<p>I must now in Charity be thought desirous
to preserve that Government in its Right
constitution, as a matter of Religion; wherein
both my judgement is fully satisfied, that it
hath of all other the fullest Scripture grounds,
and also the constant practise of all Christian
Churches; till of late years, the tumultuarinesse
of People, or the factiousnesse and pride
of Presbyters, or the covetousnesse of some
States and Princes, gave occasion to some
mens wits to invent new models, and propose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[page 149]</span>
them under suspicious titles of <i><b>Christs government,
Scepter, and Kingdom</b></i>; the better to
serve their turns, to whom the change was beneficiall.</p>

<p>They must give me leave, (having none of
their temptations to invite me to alter the
Government of Bishops, (that I may have a
title to their Estates) not to beleeve their pretended
grounds to any new waies: contrary
to the full, and constant testimony of all Histories
sufficiently convincing unbiased men;
that as the Primitive Churches were undoubtedly
governed by the Apostles and their immediate
Successours the first &amp; best Bishops:
so it cannot in reason or charity be supposed,
that all Churches in the world should either
be ignorant of the rule by them prescribed, or
so soon deviate from their divine &amp; holy pattern:
That since the first Age, for 1500 years
not one Example can be produced of any setled
Church, wherein were many Ministers and
Congregations, which had not some Bishop
above them, under whose jurisdiction and government
they were.</p>

<p>Whose constant and universall practise agreeing
with so large and evident Scripture-directions,
and examples, are set down in the
Epistles to <i><b>Timothy</b></i> and <i><b>Titus</b></i>, for the setling
of that Government not in the persons onely
<i><b>Timothy</b></i> and <i><b>Titus</b></i>, but in the succession;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[page 150]</span>
(the want of Government being that, which
the Church can no more dispence with, in
point of wel-being, then the want of the word
and Sacrament in point of being.)</p>

<p>I wonder how men came to looke with so
envious an eye upon Bishops power and authority,
as to over-see both the Ecclesiasticall
use of them, and Apostolicall constitution:
which to me seems no lesse evidently set forth,
as to the maine scope and designe of those Epistles,
for the setling of a peculiar Office,
Power, and Authority in them as President-Bishops
above others, in point of Ordination,
Censures, and other acts of Ecclesiasticall discipline;
then those shorter characters of the
qualities and duties of Presbyter-Bishops, and
Deacons are described in some parts of the
same Epistles; who in the latitude &amp; community
of the name were then, and may now not
improperly be called Bishops; as to the oversight
and care of single Congregations, committed
to them by the Apostles, or those Apostolicall
Bishops, who (as <i><b>Timothy</b></i> and <i><b>Titus</b></i>)
succeeded them, in that ordinary power,
there assigned over larger divisions in which
were many presbyters.</p>

<p>The humility of those first Bishops avoiding
the eminent title of Apostles as a name in the
Churches stile appropriated from its common
notion (<i><b>of a Messenger, or one sent</b></i>) to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[page 151]</span>
speciall dignity, which had extraordinary call,
mission, gifts and power immediately from
Christ: they contented themselves with the
ordinary titles of Bishops and Presbyters, until
Use (the great Arbitrator of words, and
Master of language) finding reason to distinguish
by a peculiar name those persons, whose
Power and Office were indeed distinct from,
and above all other in the Church, as succeeding
the Apostles in the ordinary and constant
power of governing the Churches, (the
honour of whose name they moderately, yet
commendably declined) all Christian Churches
(submitting to that special Authority) appropriated
also the name of Bishop, without
any suspicion or reproach of arrogancie, to
those who were by Apostolicall propagation
rightly descended and invested into that highest
and largest power of governing even the most
pure and Primitive Churches: which, without
all doubt, had many such holy Bishops,
after the pattern of <i><b>Timothy</b></i> and <i><b>Titus</b></i>; whose
special power is not more clearly set down in
those Epistles (the chief grounds and limits
of all Episcopall claim, as from divine Right)
then are the characters of these perilous times
and those men that make them such; who not
enduring sound Doctrine, and clear testimonies
of all Churches practice, are most perverse
Disputers, and proud Usurpers, against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[page 152]</span>
true Episcopacy: who if they be not Traytours
and Boasters, yet they seem to be very
covetous, heady, high-minded; inordinate
and fierce, lovers of themselves, having much
of the form, little of the power of godlinesse.</p>

<p>Who, by popular heaps of weak, light, and
unlearned Teachers, seek to over-lay and smother
the pregnancy &amp; authority of that power
of Episcopall Government, which, beyond
all equivocation and vulgar fallacy of names,
is most convincingly set forth, both by Scripture, and
all after Histories of the Church.</p>

<p>This I write rather like a Divine, then a
Prince, that Posterity may see (if ever these
papers be publique) that I had faire grounds
both from Scripture-Canons, and Ecclesiasticall
examples whereon my judgement was
stated for Episcopall Government.</p>

<p>Nor was it any pollicy of State or obstinacy
of will, or partiallity of affection, either to the
men, or their Function which fixed me; who
cannot in point of worldly respects be so considerable
to me as to recompence the injuries
and losses I and my dearest relations with my
Kingdomes have sustained, and hazarded,
chiefly at first upon this quarrell.</p>

<p>And not only in Religion, of which, Scripture
is the best rule, and the Churches Universall
practise the best commentary, but also
in right reason, and the true nature of Government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[page 153]</span>
it cannot be thought, that an orderly
Subordination among Presbyters, or
Ministers, should be any more against Christianity,
then it is in all secular and civill Governments,
where Parity breeds confusion and faction.</p>

<p>I can no more beleeve, that such Order is
inconsistent with true Religion, then good
features are with beautie, or numbers with
harmonie.</p>

<p>Nor is it likely that God, who appointed several
Orders, and a Prelacy, in the Government
of his Church among the Jewish Priests,
should abhor or forbid them amongst Christian
Ministers; who have as much of the principles
of Schism and division as other men; for preventing
and suppressing of which, the Apostolical
wisdom (which was Divine) after that
Christians were multiplied to many Congregations,
and Presbyters with them appointed
this way of Government, which might best
preserve Order and Union with Authority.</p>

<p>So that, I conceive, it was not the favour of
Princes, or ambition of Presbyters; but the
wisdom and piety of the Apostles, that first settled
Bishops in the Church; which Authority
they constantly used and enjoyned in those
times, which were purest for Religion, though
sharpest for Persecution.</p>

<p>Not that I am against the managing of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[page 154]</span>
Presidency and Authority in one man, by the
joynt Councell and consent of many Presbyters:
I have offered to restore that, as a fit
meanes to avoid those Errours, Corruptions,
and Partialities, which are incident to any one
man: Also to avoid Tyranny, which becoms
no Christians, least of all Church-men; besides,
it will be a means to take away that burden,
and <i><b>odium</b></i> of affairs, which may lie too
heavy on one mans shoulders, as indeed I think
it formerly did on the Bishops here.</p>

<p>Nor can I see what can be more agreeable
both to Reason and Religion, then such a
frame or Government which is paternall, not
Magistericall; and wherein not onely the necessity
of avoiding Faction and Confusion,
Emulations and Contempts, which are prone
to arise among equals in power and function;
but also the differences of some Ministers gifts,
and aptitudes for Government above others,
doth invite to imploy them, in reference to
those Abilities wherin they are Eminent.</p>

<p>Nor is this judgement of mine touching
Episcopacy, any re-occupation of opinion,
which will not admit any oppositions against
it: It is well known I have endeavoured to
satisfie my self in what the chief Patrons for
other wayes can say against this, or for
theirs: And I find they have, as far lesse of
Scripture grounds, and of Reason; so for examples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[page 155]</span>
and practice of the Church, or testimonies
of Histories, they are wholly destitute;
wherein the whole stream runs so for
Episcopacy, that there is not the least rivulet
for any others.</p>

<p>As for those obtruded examples of some
late reformed Churches (for many retain Bishops
still) whom necessity of Times and Affairs
rather excuseth, then commendeth for
their inconformity to all Antiquity; I could
never see any reason why Churches orderly
reformed, and governed by Bishops, should
be forced to conform to those few, rather
then to the catholick Example of all ancient
Churches, which needed no Reformation:
And to those Churches at this day, who governed
by Bishops in all the Christian world,
are many more then Presbyterians or Independents
can pretend to be; All whom the
Churches in my three Kingdoms, lately Governed
by Bishops, would equalize (I think)
if not exceed.</p>

<p>Nor is it any point of wisdom or charitie,
where Christians differ (as many do in some
points) there to widen the differences, and at
once to give all the Christian world (except
an handfull of some Protestants) so great a
scandall in point of Church-Government;
whom, though you may convince of their
Errours in some points of Doctrine; yet you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[page 156]</span>
shall never perswade them, that to compleat
their Reformation, they must necessarily desert,
and wholly cast off that Government,
which they, and all before them have ever
owned as Catholick, Primitive, and Apostolical,
so far, that never Schismaticks nor Hereticks
(except those Arrians) have strayed from
the Unitie and Conformitie of the Church in
that point; ever having Bishops above Presbyters.</p>

<p>Besides, the late generall approbation and
submission to this Government of Bishops, by
the Clergy, as well as the Laitie of these Kingdomes,
is a great confirmation of my Judgment;
and their inconstancie is a great prejudice
against their noveltie: I cannot in charity
so far doubt of their Learning or Integrity, as
if they understood not what heretofore they
did; or that they did conform contrary to their
Consciences: So that their facility and levity is
never to be excused, who, before ever the point
of Church-government had any free &amp; impartiall
Debate, contrary to their former Oathes
and Practice, against their obedience to the
Lawes in force, and against my Consent, have
not onely quite cryed down the Government
by Bishops; but have approved and incouraged
the violent and most illegall stripping all the
Bishops, and many other Church-men, of all
their due Authority and Revenues, even to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[page 157]</span>
the selling away, and utter alienation of those
Church-lands from any Ecclesiastical uses: So
great a power hath the stream of times, and the
prevalency of parties over some mens judgments;
of whose so sudden and so total change,
little reason can be given, besides the <i><b>Scots</b></i> Armie
coming into <i><b>England</b></i>.</p>

<p>But the folly of these men will at last punish
it self, and the Desertors of Episcopacy will
appear the greatest Enemies to, and Betrayers
of their own Interest: For Presbytery is never
so considerable or effectuall, as when it is
joyned to, and crowned with Episcopacy. All
Ministers wil find as great a difference in point
of thriving, between the favour of the people,
and of Princes, as plants do between being
watered by hand, or by the sweet and liberall
dews of Heaven.</p>

<p>The tenuity and contempt of Clergy-men
will soon let them see, what a poor carcasse
they are, when parted from the influence of
that Head, to whose Supremacy they have been
sworn.</p>

<p>A little moderation might have prevented
great mischiefs. I am firm to primitive Episcopacie,
not to have it extirpated (if I can
hinder it.) Discretion without passion might
easily reform what-ever the rust of Times, or
indulgence of Laws, or corruption of Manners
have brought upon it. It being a grosse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[page 158]</span>
vulgar errour, to impute to, or revenge upon
the Function, the faults of Times or Persons;
which seditious and popular principle and
practice all wise men abhor.</p>

<p>For these secular Additaments and Ornaments
of Authority, Civil Honour and Estate,
which my Predecessours and Christian Princes
in all Countries have annexed to Bishops and
Church-men; I look upon them but as just
rewards of their learning and piety, who are fit
to be in any degree of Church-Government:
also enablements to works of Charitie and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Hospitaliy'">Hospitality</ins>, meet strengthnings of their Authoritie
in point of respect and observance; which
in peacefull Times is hardly paid to any Governours
by the measure of their Vertues, so
much, as by that of their Estates; Povertie
and meanness exposing them and their Authority
to the contempt of licentious mindes and
manners, which persecuting Times much restrained.</p>

<p>I would have such men Bishops, as are most
worthy of those encouragements, and best able
to use them: if at any time my judgment of
men failed, my good intention made my errour
veniall: And some Bishops, I am sure, I
had, whose learning, gravitie, and pietie, no
men of any worth or forehead can deny: But,
of all men, I would have Church-men, especially
the Governours, to be redeemed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[page 159]</span>
that vulgar neglect; (which besides an innate
principle of vitious opposition, which is in all
men against those that seem to reprove, or restrain
them) will necessarily follow both the
Presbyterian parity, which makes all Ministers
equall; and the Independent inferiority,
which sets their Pastor below the People.</p>

<p>This for My judgment touching Episcopacy,
wherein (Gods knows) I doe not gratifie
any design or passion with the least perverting
of Truth.</p>

<p>And now I appeal to God above, and all
the Christian world, whether it be just for
Subjects, or pious for Christians, by violence,
and infinite indignities, with servile restraints
to seek to force Me their <span class="sc">King</span> and Soveraign,
as some men have endevoured to doe,
against all these grounds of my Judgment, to
consent to their weak and divided novelties.</p>

<p>The greatest Pretender of them desires not
more than I doe, That the Church should be
governed, as Christ hath appointed, in true
Reason, and in Scripture; of which, I could
never see any probable shew for any other
waies: who either content themselves with
the examples of some Churches in their infancy
and solitude; when one Presbyter might
serve one Congregation, in a City or Countrey;
or else they deny these most evident
Truths, That the Apostles were Bishops over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[page 160]</span>
Those Presbyters they ordained, as well as over
the Churches they planted; and that Government
being necessary for the Churches
wel-being when multiplied and sociated, must
also necessarily descend from the Apostles to
others, after the example of that power and
Superiority they had above others: which
could not end with their Persons, since the
use and ends of such Government still continue.</p>

<p>It is most sure, that the purest Primitive and
best Churches flourished under Episcopacy;
and may so still, if ignorance, superstition, avarice,
revenge, and other disorderly and disloyal
passions had not so blown up some mens
minds against it, that what they want of Reasons
or primitive Patterns, they supply with
violence and oppressions; wherein some mens
zeal for Bishops Lands, Houses and Revenues
hath set them on work to eat up Episcopacy:
which (however other men esteem) to Me
is no lesse sin then Sacriledge, or a robbery of
God (the giver of all we have) of that portion
which devout minds have thankfully given
again to him, in giving it to his Church and
Prophets; through whose hands he graciously
accepts even a cup of cold water, as a libation
offered to himself.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as to my particular Engagement
above other men, by an Oath agreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[page 161]</span>
to my <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'judement'">judgement</ins>, I am solemnly obliged to
preserve that Government, and the rights
of the Church.</p>

<p>Were I convinced of the unlawfullnesse of
the Function, as Antichristian, (which some
men boldly, but weakly calumniate) I could
soone, with Judgement, breake that Oath,
which erroneously was taken by me.</p>

<p>But being daily by the best disquisition of
truth, more confirmed in the reason and
Religion of that, to which I am sworn; How
can any man that wisheth not my damnation,
perswade me at once to so notorious
and combined sins, of Sacriledge &amp; Perjury?
besides the many personall Injustices I must
doe to many worthy men, who are as legally
invested in their Estates, as any, who seeke to
deprive them; and they have by no Law, been
convicted of those crimes, which might forfeit
their Estates and Lively-hoods.</p>

<p>I have often wondred how men pretending
to tendernesse of Conscience and Reformation,
can at once tell me, that my Coronation
Oath binds me to Consent to whatsoever
they shall propound to Me (which they urge
with such violence) though contrary to all
that Rationall and Religious freedom which
every man ought to preserve, &amp; of which they
seem so tender in their own Votes: yet at the
same time these men will needs perswade Me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[page 162]</span>
That I must, and ought to dispense with, and
roundly break that part of my Oath, which
binds Me (agreeable to the best light of Reason
and Religion I have) to maintain the Government,
and legall Rights of the Church.
'Tis strange, my lot should be valid in that
part, which both my Self, and all men in their
own case, esteem injurious and unreasonable,
as being against the very naturall and essentiall
libertie of our Souls; yet it should be invalid,
and to be broken in another clause, wherein
I think my Self justly obliged both to God and
Man.</p>

<p>Yet upon this Rack chiefly have I been held
so long, by some mens ambitious Covetousnesse,
and sacrilegious Cruelty; torturing
(with Me) both Church and State in Civill
Dissentions, til I shall be forced to consent, and
declare that I do approve, what (God knows)
I utterly dislike, and in my Soul abhor, as many
wayes highly against Reason, Justice, and Religion:
and whereto, if I should shamefully
and dishonorably give my consent; yet should
I not by so doing, satisfie the divided Interests
and Opinions of those Parties, which contend
with each other, as well as both against Me
and Episcopacy.</p>

<p>Nor can my late condescending to the <i><b>Scots</b></i>
in point of Church-Government, be rightly
objected against me, as an inducement for me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[page 163]</span>
to consent to the like in my other Kingdoms;
For it should be considered, That Episcopacie
was not so rooted and setled there, as 'tis here;
nor I (in that respect) so strictly bound to continue
it in that Kingdom, as in this; for what
I think in my judgment best, I may not think
so absolutely necessary for all places, and at all
times.</p>

<p>If any shall impute my yeelding to them as
my failing and sin, I can easily acknowledge it;
but that is no argument to do so again, or much
worse; I being now more convinced in that
point: nor indeed, hath my yeelding to them
been so happy and successfull, as to encourage
me to grant the like to others.</p>

<p>Did I see any thing more of Christ, as to
Meeknesse, Justice, Order, Charity, and Loyaltie
in those that pretended to other modes of
Government, I might suspect my Judgment
to be biassed, or fore-stalled with some prejudice
and wontednesse of opinion: but I have
hitherto so much cause to suspect the contrary
in the manners of many of those men, that I
cannot from them gain the least reputation for
their new ways of Government.</p>

<p>Nor can I find, that in any Reformed Churches
(whose patterns are so cried up, and obtruded
upon the Churches under my Dominion)
that either Learning, or Religion,
works of Piety or Charity, have so flourished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[page 164]</span>
beyond what they have done in my Kingdoms
(by Gods blessing) which might make
me believe either Presbytery or Independency
have a more benigne influence upon
the Church and mens hearts and lives, then
Episcopacy in its right constitution.</p>

<p>The abuses of which, deserve to be extirpated,
as much as the use retained; for I think
it farre better to hold to primitive and uniforme
Antiquity, then to comply with divided
novelty.</p>

<p>A right Episcopacy would at once satisfie
all just desires and interests of good Bishops,
humble presbyters, and sober People; so as
Church affaires should be managed neither
with tyrannie, paritie nor popularitie; neither
Bishops ejected, nor presbyters dispised, nor
People oppressed,</p>

<p>And in this integrity both of my Judgement
and Conscience, I hope God will preserve
me.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">18. <i>Upon</i> Uxbridge <i>Treaty, and other Offers made by the</i> <span class="sc">King</span>.</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">I</span>
<b>Looke</b> upon the way of Treaties, as a retiring
from fighting like beasts, to arguing
like men; whose strength should be more in
their understandings, then in their limbs.</p>

<p>And though I could seldom get opportunities
to Treat, yet I never wanted either desire
or disposition to it; having greater confidence
of my Reason, then my Sword. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[page 167]</span>
was so wholy resolved to yeild to the first, that
I thought neither my self, not others, should
need to use the second, if once we rightly understood
each other.</p>

<p>Nor did I ever think it a diminution of me,
to prevent them with expresses of my desires,
and even importunities to Treat: It being an
office not only of humanity, rather to use Reason
then Force; but also of Christianitie to
<i><b>seek peace and ensue it</b></i>.</p>

<p>As I am very unwillingly compelled to defend
my self with Armes, so I very willingly
embraced any thing tending to Peace.</p>

<p>The events of all War by the Sword being
very dubious, and of a Civill war uncomfortable;
the end hardly recompencing, and late
repairing the mischiefe of the means.</p>

<p>Nor did any successe I had ever enhaunce
with me the price of Peace, as earnestly desired
by me as any man; though I was like to pay
dearer for it then any man: All that I sought
to reserve, was, mine Honour and my Conscience;
the one I could not part with as a King,
the other as a Christian.</p>

<p>The Treaty at <i><b>Vxbridg</b></i> gave the fairest hopes
of an happy composure; had others applied
themselves to it with the same moderation, as
I did, I am confident the war had then ended.</p>

<p>I was willing to condescend, as far as Reason,
Honour, and Conscience, would give me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[page 168]</span>
leave: nor were the remaining differences so
essentiall to my peoples happinesse, or of such
consequence, as in the least kind to have hindred
my Subjects either security or prosperity;
for they better enjoyed both many yeers, before
ever those demands were made; some of which
to deny, I think the greatest Justice to my Self,
and favour to my Subjects.</p>

<p>I see Jealousies are not so easily allayed, as
they are raised: Some men are more afraid
to retreat from violent Engagements, then to
Engage: what is wanting in Equity, must be
made up in Pertinacie. Such as had little to
enjoy in Peace, or to lose in War, studied to
render the very name of <i><b>Peace</b></i> odious and
suspected.</p>

<p>In Church-affairs, where I had least libertie
of prudence, having so many strict ties of Conscience
upon me, yet I was willing to condescend
so farr to the setling of them, as might
have given fair satisfaction to all men, whom
Faction, Covetousness, or Superstition had not
engaged, more then any true zeal, charity, or
love of Reformation.</p>

<p>I was content to yeeld to all that might seem
to advance true piety; I onely sought to continue
what was necessary in point of Order,
Maintenance, and Authority to the Churches
Government; and what I am perswaded (as I
have else-where set down my thoughts more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[page 169]</span>
fully) is most agreeable to the true principles
of all Government, raised to its full stature
and perfection, as also to the primitive Apostolicall
patterne, and the practice of the Universall
Church conform therunto.</p>

<p>From which wholly to recede, without any
probable reason urged or answered, only to
satisfie some mens wills and fantasies (which
yet agree not among themselves in any point,
but that of extirpating Episcopacy, and fighting
against Me) must needs argue such a softnesse,
and infirmity of mind in Me, as will rather
part with Gods Truth, then mans Peace,
and rather lose the Churches honour, then
crosse some mens factious humours.</p>

<p>God knows, and time will discover, who
were most to blame for the un-successfulnesse
of that Treaty, and who must bear the guilt of
after-calamities. I beleeve, I am very excusable
both before God, and all unpassionate
men, who have seriously weighed those transactions,
wherein I endeavoured no lesse the restauration
of peace to my people, then the preservation
of my own Crowns to my posterity.</p>

<p>Some men have that height, as to interpret
all faire condescendings as arguments of feeblenesse,
and glory most in an unflexible stifnesse,
when they see others most supple and
inclinable to them.</p>

<p>A grand Maxime with them was alwayes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[page 170]</span>
to ask something, which in Reason and Honour
must be denied, that they might have
some colour to refuse all that was in other
things granted; setting Peace at as high a
rate, as the worst effects of Warr; endevouring
first to make Me destroy My self by dishonourable
Concessions, that so they might
have the less to do.</p>

<p>This was all which that Treaty, or any
other produced, to let the world see how little
I would deny, or they grant, in order to the
publick Peace.</p>

<p>That it gave occasion to some mens further
restivenesse, is imputable to their own depraved
tempers, not to any Concessions or negations
of Mine: I have alwayes the content of
what I offered, and they the regret and blame,
for what they refused.</p>

<p>The highest tide of success set me not above
a Treaty, nor the lowest ebbe below a Fight:
Though I never thought it any sign of true
valour, to be prodigal of mens lives, rather then
be drawne to produce our own Reasons, or
subscribe to other mens.</p>

<p>That which made me for the most part presage
the unsuccesfulnesse of any Treaty, was,
some mens unwillingnesse to Treat: which
implied some things were to be gained by
the Sword, whose unseasonableness they were
loth to have fairly scanned, being more proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[page 171]</span>
to be acted by Souldiers, then by Counsellours.</p>

<p>I pray God forgive them that were guilty
of that Treaties breaking: and give them
grace to make their advantages gotten by the
Sword a better opportunity to use such moderation
as was then wanting; that so though
Peace were for our sins justly deferred, yet at
last it might be happily obtained; what we
could not get by our Treaties, we may gaine
by our prayers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>O thou, that art the God of Reason, and of

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">19. <i>Upon the various events of the warre, victories, and defeats.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>He</b> various successes of this unhappy war,
have at least, afforded me variety of good
meditations: sometimes God was pleased to
try me with victory, by worsting my enemies,
that I might know how with moderation
and thanks to own, and use his power,
who is the onely true Lord of Hosts, able
when he pleases to represse the confidence of
those who fought against mee with so great
advantage for power and number.</p>

<p>From small beginnings on my part, hee let
me see, that I was not wholly for saken by my
peoples love, or his protection.</p>

<p>Other times God was pleased to exercise
my patience, and teach me not to trust in the
arm of Flesh, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bnt'">but</ins> in the living God.</p>

<p>My sins sometimes prevailed against the justice
of my cause, and those that were with me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[page 173]</span>
wanted not matter and occasion for his just
chastisement both of them and Mee: Nor
were My Enemies lesse punished by that prosperity
which hardened them to continue
that injustice by open hostilitie, which was begun
by most riotous and un-Parliamentary Tumults.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but personall and private
sins may oft-times over-balance the Justice
of publick Engagements; nor doth God
account every gallant man (in the worlds esteem)
a fit instrument to assert in the way of
War a righteous Cause: The more men are
prone to arrogate to their own skill, valour,
and strength, the lesse doth God ordinarily
work by them for his own glory.</p>

<p>I am sure the event or successe can never
state the Justice of any Cause, nor the peace of
mens Consciences, nor the eternall fate of their
Souls.</p>

<p>Those with Me had (I think) clearly and
undoubtedly, for their justification, the Word
of God, and the Lawes of the Land, together
with their own Oathes; all requiring obedience
to my just Commands; but to none other
under Heaven without me, or against me
in the point of raising Arms.</p>

<p>Those on the other side are forced to flie to
the shifts of some pretended Fears, and wilde
Fundamentals of State (as they call them)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[page 174]</span>
which actually overthrow the present fabrick
both of Church and State; being such imaginary
Reasons for self-defence as are most impertinent
for those men to alledge, who being
my Subjects, were manifestly the first assaulters
of Me and the Laws: first, by unsuppressing
the Tumults, after by listed Forces: The same
Allegations they use, will fit any Faction that
hath but power and confidence enough to second
with the Sword all their Demands against
the present Laws and Governours; which
can never be such as some side or other will
not find fault with, so as to urge what they
call a Reformation of them to a Rebellion against
them: some parasitick Preachers have
dared to call those Martyrs, who died fighting
against Me, the Laws, their Oaths, and the Religion
established.</p>

<p>But sober Christians know, That glorious
Title can with truth be applied onely to those,
who sincerely preferred Gods Truth and their
duty in all these particulars before their lives,
and all that was dear to them in this world;
who having no advantageous Designes by any
Innovasion, were Religiously sensible of those
ties to God, the Church, and my Self, which
lay upon their souls, both for obedience, and
just assistance.</p>

<p>God could, and I doubt not but hee did
through his mercy, crown many of them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[page 175]</span>
eternall life, whose lives were lost in so just a
Cause; the destruction of their bodies being
sanctified as a means to save their souls.</p>

<p>Their Wounds and temporal Ruine serving
as a gracious opportunity for their eternall
Health and Happinesse; while the evident approach
of death, through Gods grace, effectually
dispose their hearts to such Humilitie,
Faith, and Repentance, which together with
the Rectitude of their present Engagement,
would fully prepare them for a better life then
that which their enemies brutish and disloyall
fiercenesse could deprive them of; or without
repentance hope to enjoy.</p>

<p>They have often, indeed, had the better
against my side in the Field, but never, I beleeve
at the Bar of Gods Tribunal, or their
own Consciences; where they are more
afraid to encounter those many pregnant
Reasons, both for Law, Allegiance, and all
true Christian grounds, which conflicts <i><b>with</b></i>,
and accuse them <i><b>in</b></i> their own thoughts, then
they oft were in a desperate bravery to fight
against those Forces which sometimes God
gave me.</p>

<p>Whose condition conquered, and dying, I
make no question, but is infinitely more to be
chosen by a sober man (that duly values his
duty, his soul and eternity, beyond the enjoyment
of this present life) then the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[page 176]</span>
triumphant glory, wherein their and mine
Enemies supervive; who can hardly avoid to
be daily tormented by that horrid guilt, wherewith
their suspicious, or now convicted Consciences
do pursue them, especially since they
and all the world have seen, how false and unintended
those pretensions were, which they
first set forth, as the onely plausible (though
not justifiable) grounds of raising a War, and
continuing it thus long against Me, and the
Laws established; in whose safety and preservation
all honest men think the welfare of their
Country doth consist.</p>

<p>For, and with all which, it is far more honourable
and comfortable to suffer, then to
prosper in their ruine and subversion.</p>

<p>I have often prayed, that all on my side
might join true pietie with the sense of their
Loyalty; and be as faithfull to God and their
own souls, as they were to Me; That the defects
of the one might not blast the endeavours
of the other.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot think, that any shews of truth
of piety on the other side were sufficient to dispence
with, or expiate the defects of their dutie
and Loyaltie to Me, which have so pregnant
convictions on mens consciences, that even
profaner men are moved by the sense of them
to venture their lives for Me.</p>

<p>I never had any Victory which was without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[page 177]</span>
My sorrow, because it was on Mine own
Subjects, who, like <i><b>Absolom</b></i>, died many of
them in their sin: And yet I never suffered any
Defeat which made Me despair of Gods mercy
and defence.</p>

<p>I never desired such victories, as might serve
to conquer, but only restore the Laws and
Liberties of My people; which I saw were
extremly oppressed, together with my rights,
by those men, who were impatient of any just
restraint.</p>

<p>When Providence gave Me, or denied Me
Victory, my desire was never to boast of my
power nor to charge God foolishly; who I
believed at last would make all things to work
together for my good.</p>

<p>I wished no greater advantages by the War,
then to bring my Enemies to moderation, and
my Friends to peace.</p>

<p>I was afraid of the temptation of an absolute
conquest, and never prayed more for
Victory over others, then over my self. When
the first was denied, the second was granted
me, which God saw best for me.</p>

<p>The different events were but the methods
of divine justice, by contrary winds to winow
us: That, by punishing our sins, he might
purge them from us; and by deferring peace,
he might prepare us more to prize, and better
to use so great a blessing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[page 178]</span>

<p>My often Messages for Peace shewed, that
I delighted not in Warre; as my former
Concessions sufficiently testified, how willingly
I would have prevented it; and My totall
unpreparedness for it, how little <i>I</i> intended
it.</p>

<p>The Conscience of my Innocence forbad
Me to fear a Warr; but the love of my Kingdoms
commanded me (if possible) to avoid
it.</p>

<p>I am guilty in this War of nothing but
this, That I gave such advantages to some
men, by confirming their power, which they
knew not to use with that modesty and gratitude,
which became their loyalty and My
confidence.</p>

<p>Had I yeelded lesse, I had been opposed
lesse; had I denied more, I had been more
obeyed.</p>

<p>'Tis now too late to review the occasions
of the War; I wish only a happy conclusion
of so unhappy beginnings: The inevitable
fate of our sins was (no doubt) such, as
would no longer suffer the divine Justice to
be quiet: we having conquered this patience,
are condemned by mutuall conquerings, to
destroy one another: for, the most prosperous
successes on either side, impair the welfare of
the whole.</p>

<p>Those Victories are still miserable, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[page 179]</span>
leave our sins unsubdued; flushing our pride,
and animating to continue injuries.</p>

<p>Peace is not it self desirable, till repentance
hath prepared us for it.</p>

<p>When we fight more against our selves,
and lesse against God, we shall cease fighting
against one another; I pray God these
may all meet in our hearts, and so dispose
us to an happy conclusion of these Civil-Wars;
that I may know better to obey God, and
govern my people, and they may learn better
to obey both God and me.</p>

<p>Nor do <i>I</i> desire any man should be further
subject to me, then all of us may be subject
to God.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">20. <i>Upon the Reformation of the Times.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">N</span>
<b>O</b> Glory is more to be envied then that
of due reforming either Church or State,
when deformities are such, that the perturbation
and noveltie are not like to exceed the benefit
of Reforming.</p>

<p>Although God should not honour me so far,
as to make me an Instrument of so good a
work, yet <i>I</i> should be glad to see it done.</p>

<p>As I was well pleased with this Parliaments
first intentions to reform what the indulgence
of Times, and corruption of manners might
have depraved; so I am sorry to see after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[page 182]</span>
freedom of Parliament was by factious Tumults
oppressed, how little regard was had to
the good Laws established, and the Religion
setled; which ought to be the first rule and
standard of Reforming: with how much partiality
and popular compliance the passions
and opinions of men have been gratified, to the
detriment of the Publick, and the infinite scandall
of the reformed Religion?</p>

<p>What dissolutions of all Order and Government
in the Church? what novelties
of Schism, and corrupt opinions? what undecencies
and confusions in sacred Administrations?
what sacrilegious Invasions upon
the Rights and Revenues of the Church? what
contempt and oppressions of the Clergie?
what injurious diminutions and persecutings
of Me have followed (as showers do warm
gleams) the talk of Reformation, all sober men
are Witnesses, and with my self, sad Spectators
hitherto.</p>

<p>The great miscarriage (I think) is, that popular
clamours and fury have been allowed the
reputation of zeal, and the Publick sense; so
that the studies to please some Parties, hath indeed
injured all.</p>

<p>Freedom, Moderation and Impartiality are
sure the best tempers of reforming Counsels
and endeavours; what is acted by Factions,
cannot but offend more then it pleaseth.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[page 183]</span>

<p>I have offered to put all differences in
Church affairs and Religion to the free consultation
of a Synod or Convocation rightly
chosen; the results of whose Councels, as
they would have included the Votes of all,
so its like they would have given most satisfaction
to all.</p>

<p>The Assembly of Divines, whom the two
Houses have applied (in an unwonted way)
to advise of Church affairs, I dislike not farther,
then that they are not legally convened
and chosen; nor act in the name of all
the Clergy of <i><b>England</b></i>; nor with freedom
and impartiality can do any thing, being limited
and confined, if not overawed, to do and
declare what they do.</p>

<p>For I cannot think so many men cried up
for learning and piety, who formerly allowed
the Liturgy and Government of the Church
of <i><b>England</b></i>, as to the main, would have so suddenly
agreed quite to abolish both of them,
(the last of which, they know to be of Apostolicall
institution, at least; as of Primitive
and Universall practice) if they had been left
to the liberty of their own suffrages, and if the
influence of contrary factions had not by secret
encroachments of hopes and fears, prevailed
upon them, to comply with so great
and dangerous Innovations in the Church;
without any regard to their own former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[page 184]</span>
judgment and practice, or to the common interest
and honour of all the Clergy, and in them of
Order, learning, and Religion against examples
of all Ancient Churches; the Lawes in
force and my consent; which is never to be
gained, against so pregnant light, as in that
point shines on my understanding.</p>

<p>For I conceive, that where the Scripture is
not so clear and punctuall in precepts, there
the constant and Universall practice of the
Church, in things not contrary to Reason,
Faith, good Manners, or any positive Command,
is the best rule that Christians can follow.</p>

<p>I was willing to grant, or restore to Presbytery,
what with Reason or Discretion it can
pretend to, in a conjuncture with Episcopacy;
but for that wholy to invade the Power, and
by the Sword to arrogate, and quite <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'abrogae'">abrogate</ins>
the Authority of that Ancient Order, I thinke
neither just, as to episcopacy, nor safe for Presbytery;
nor yet any way convenient for this
Church or State.</p>

<p>A due reformation had easily followed moderate
Counsels: and such (I beleeve) as would
have given more content, even to the most of
those Divines, who have been led on with
much Gravity and formality, to carry on other
mens designes which no doubt many of
them by this time discover, though they dare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[page 185]</span>
not but smother their frustrations and discontents.</p>

<p>The specious and popular Titles of Christs
Government, Throne, Scepter, and Kingdom,
(which certainly is not divided, nor
hath two faces, as their parties now have at
least) also the noise of a thorow-Reformation,
these may as easily be fined on new models, as
fair colours may be put to ill-favoured Figures.</p>

<p>The breaking of Church-windows, which
time had sufficiently defaced; pulling down
of Crosses, which were but Civill, not Religious
marks; defacing of Monuments, and
Inscriptions of the dead, which served but to
put Posterity in minde, to thank God for that
clearer light wherein they live: The leaving
of Ministers to their liberties, and private
abilities in the publick service of God, where
no Christian can tell to what hee may say
<i><b>Amen</b></i>; nor what adventure he may make of
seeming, at least, to consent to the Errours,
Blasphemies, and ridiculous Undecencies
which bold and ignorant men list to vent in
their Prayers, Preaching, and other Offices;
Their setting forth also of old Catechisms, and
Confessions of Faith new drest, importing as
much, as if there had been no sound or cleer
Doctrine of Faith in this Church, before some
four or five yeers consultation had matured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[page 186]</span>
their thoughts touching their first principles
of Religion.</p>

<p>All these and the like are the effects of
popular, specious, and deceitfull Reformations,
(that they might not seem to have nothing
to do) and may give some short flashes
of content to the Vulgar, (who are taken
with novelties, as children with babies, very
much, but not very long) but all this amounts
not to, nor can in justice merit the
glory of the Churches thorow-Reformation;
since they leave all things more deformed, disorderly,
and discontented then when they began,
in point of Piety, Morality, Charity, and
good Order.</p>

<p>Nor can they easily recompence or remedie
the inconveniences and mischiefs which they
have purchased so dearly, and which have,
and will ever necessarily ensue, till due remedies
be applied.</p>

<p>I wish they would at last make it their unanimous
work to do Gods work, and not their
own: Had Religion been first considered (as
it merited) much trouble might have been
prevented.</p>

<p>But some men thought, that the Government
of this Church and State, fixed by so many
Lawes, and long Customes, would not run
into their new <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'moudls'">moulds</ins>, till they had first melted
it in the fire of a Civil Warr; by the advantages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[page 187]</span>
of which they resolved, if they prevailed,
to make my Self and all my Subjects
fall down and worship the Images they
should form and set up. If there had been as
much of Christs Spirit, for meeknesse, wisdom
and charitie in mens hearts, as there was
of his name used in the pretensions to reform
all to Christs Rule, it would certainly have
obtained more of Gods blessing, and produced
more of Christs Glory, the Churches good,
the honour of Religion, and the unity of
Christians.</p>

<p>Publick Reformers had need first act in private,
and practice that on their own hearts,
which they purpose to try on others; for Deformities
within will soon betray the pretenders
of publick Reformations to such private designs,
as must needs hinder the publick good.</p>

<p>I am sure, the right Methods of Reforming
the Church, cannot subsist with that of perturbing
the Civil State; nor can Religion be
justly advanced by depressing Loyaltie, which
is one of the chiefest Ingredients, and Ornaments
of true Religion: for next to <i><b>Fear God</b></i>,
is, <i><b>Honour the King</b></i>.</p>

<p>I doubt not but Christs Kingdom may be
set up without pulling down mine; nor will
any men in impartiall times appear good
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Christans'">Christians</ins>, that approve not them selves good
Subjects.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[page 188]</span>

<p>Christs Government will confirm Mine,
not overthrow it, since as I own Mine from
Him, so I desire to rule for his Glory, and his
Churches good.</p>

<p>Had some men truly intended Christs Government,
or knew what it meant in their
hearts, they could never have been so ill governed
in their words and actions, both against
Me, and one another.</p>

<p>As good ends cannot justifie evill means; so
nor will evill beginnings ever bring forth
good conclusions: unless God by a miracle of
Mercie create Light out of Darknesse, Order
out of our Confusions, and peace out of our
passions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>Thou, O Lord, who onely canst give us beauty

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">T</span>
<b>HE</b> taking of My Letters was an opportunity,
which, as the malice of
Mine <span class="sc">Enemies</span> could hardly have expected;
so they know not how with honour
and civility to use it: Nor do I thinke with
sober and worthy minds any thing in them,
could tend so much to my reproach, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[page 190]</span>
odious divulging of them did to the infamy
of the Divulgers: The greatest experiments
of Vertue and Noblenesse being discovered
in the greatest advantages against an enemy,
and the greatest obligations being those,
which are put upon us by them, from whom
we could least have expected them.</p>

<p>And such I should have esteemed the concealing
of my Papers; the freedom and secresie
of which, commands a civility from
all men, not wholly barbarous; nor is there
any thing more inhumane then to expose them
to publick view.</p>

<p>Yet since Providence will have it so, I am
content so much of My heart (which I study
to approve to Gods omniscience) should be
discovered to the world without any of those
dresses or popular captations which some
men use in their Speeches and Expresses; I
wish My Subjects had a cleerer sight into My
most retired Thoughts.</p>

<p>Where they might discover, how they are
divided between the love and care I have,
not more to preserve My own Rights, then to
procure their Peace and Happinesse, and that
extreme grief to see them both deceiv'd and
destroyed.</p>

<p>Nor can any mens malice be gratified
further by My Letters, than to see my constancy
to my Wife, the Laws, and Religion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[page 191]</span>
Bees will gather honey where the Spider sucks
Poyson.</p>

<p>That I endeavour to avoid the pressures
of my Enemies, by all fair and just correspondences;
no man can blame, who loves
Me, or the Common-wealth, since my Subjects
can hardly be happy if I be miserable, or enjoy
their Peace and Liberties while I am oppressed.</p>

<p>The world may see how soon mens designe,
like <i><b>Absoloms</b></i>, is by enormous actions
to widen differences, and exasperate all sides
to such distances, as may make all Reconciliation
desperate.</p>

<p>Yet I thank God, I can not only with patience
bear this, as other indignities, but with
charity forgive them.</p>

<p>The integrity of my intentions is not jealous
of any injury my expressions can do them,
for although the confidence of privacy may
admit of greater freedome in writing such
letters, which may be liable to envious exceptions;
yet the innocency of my chief purposes
cannot be so obtained, or mis-interpreted by
them, as not to let all men see, that I wish
nothing more then a happy composure of
differences with Justice &amp; Honor, nor more to
My own, then My peoples content, who have
any sparks of Love or Loyalty left in them:
who, by those my Letters may be convinced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[page 192]</span>
that I can both mind and act My own, and
My Kingdomes Affaires, so as becomes a
Prince; which Mine Enemies have alwayes
been very loth should be beleeved of me, as if
I were wholly confined to the Dictates and
Directions of others; whom they please to
brand with the names of Evil Counsellours.</p>

<p>Its probable some men will now look upon
me as my own Counsellour, and having none
else to quarrell with under that notion, they
will hereafter confine their anger to my self:
Although I know they are very unwilling I
should enjoy the liberty of my own thoughts,
or follow the light of my own Conscience,
which they labour to bring into an absolute
captivitie to themselves; not allowing me to
think their Counsels to be other then good
for me, which have so long maintained a War
against Me.</p>

<p>The Victory they obtained that day, when
my Letters became their prize, had been enough
to have satiated the most ambitious
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thrist'">thirst</ins> of popular glory among the Vulgar;
with whom prosperity gaines the greatest
esteem and applause as adversity exposeth
to their greatest sleighting and dis-respect:
As if good fortune were alwayes the shadow
of Vertue and Justice, and did not oftner
attend vitious and injurious actions, as to
this world.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[page 193]</span>

<p>But I see no secular advantages seem sufficient
to that cause, which began with Tumults,
and depends chiefly upon the reputation with
the vulgar.</p>

<p>They think no Victories so effectual to their
designs, as those that most rout and waste My
Credit with My People; in whose hearts they
seek by all means to smother and extinguish
all sparks of Love, Respect and Loyaltie to Me,
that they may never kindle again, so as to recover
Mine, the Laws &amp; the Kingdoms Liberties,
which some men seek to overthrow: The taking
away of my Credit, is but a necessary preparation
to the taking away of my Life and my
Kingdoms; first I must seem neither fit to Live,
nor worthy to Reign: By exquisite methods of
cunning &amp; crueltie, I must be compelled, first
to follow the Funerals of my Honor, and then
be destroyed: But I know Gods un-erring and
impartial justice can &amp; will over rule the most
perverse wils and designs of men; he is able, and
(I hope) will turn even the worst of mine Enemies
thoughts and actions to my good.</p>

<p>Nor do I think, that by the surprize of my
Letters, I have lost any more then so many papers:
how much they have lost of that reputation,
for Civility and Humanity (which ought
to be paid to all men, and most becomes such as
pretend to Religion) besides that of Respect and
Honor, which they owe to their <span class="sc">King</span>, present,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[page 194]</span>
and after-times will judge. And I cannot
think that their own consciences are so stupid,
as not to inflict upon them some secret impressions
of that shame &amp; dishonor which attends
all unworthy actions have they never so
much of publick flattery and popular countenance.</p>

<p>I am sure they can never expect the divine approbation
of such indecent actions, if they
do but remember how God blest the modest
respect &amp; filial tenderness which <i><b>Noah's</b></i> Sons
bare to their Father; nor did his open infirmity
justifie <i><b>Cham's</b></i> impudency, or exempt him from
that curse of being <i><b>Servant of Servants</b></i>; which
curse must needs be on them who seek by dishonorable
actions to please the Vulgar, and confirm
by ignoble acts, their dependance upon the
People.</p>

<p>Nor can their malitious intentions be ever
either excusable or prosperous, who thought to
expose me to the highest reproach &amp; contempt
of my People, forgetting that duty of modest
concealment which they owed to the Father
of their Country, in case they had discovered any
real uncomliness, which, I thank God they
did not; who can, and I believe hath made Me
more respected in the hearts of many (as he did
<i><b>David</b></i>) to whom they thought, by publishing
my private Letters, to have rendred me as a vile

rest my head: shewing me that himself is the
safest Refuge, and the strongest Tower of defence,
in which I may put my trust.</p>

<p>In these extremities, I look not to man so
much as to God: He will have it thus, that I
may cast my self, and my now distressed Affairs
upon his mercy, who hath both hearts
and hands of all men in his dispose.</p>

<p>What Providence denies to Force, it may
grant to Prudence; Necessity is now my
Counsellor, and commands Me to study My
safety by a disguised withdrawing from my
chiefest strength, and adventuring upon their
Loyalty, who first began my troubles. Happily,
God may make them a means honorable to
compose them.</p>

<p>This my confidence of them, may dis-arm &amp; overcom
them; my rendring my person to them,
may engage their affection to me, who have oft
professed, <i><b>They fought not against me, but for
me</b></i>.</p>

<p>I must now resolve the riddle of their Loyalty:
and give them opportunity to let the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[page 198]</span>
see, they mean not what they do, but what
they say.</p>

<p>Yet must God be my chiefest Guard; and my
Conscience both my Counsellor and my Comforter:
Though I put my body into their hands,
yet I shall reserve my soul to God and my self;
nor shall any necessities compell me, to desert
mine honour, or swerve from my Judgement.</p>

<p>What they fought to take by force, shall
now be given them in such a way of unusuall
confidence of them, as may make them ashamed
not to be really such as they ought, and professed
to be.</p>

<p>God sees it not enough to desert me of all Military
power to defend my Self, but to put me
upon using their power, who seem to fight against
me, yet ought in duty to defend me.</p>

<p>So various are all humane affairs, &amp; so necessitous
may the state of Princes be, that their
greatest danger may be in their supposed safety,
and their safety in their supposed danger.</p>

<p>I must now leave those that have Adhered to
me, and apply to those that have Opposed me;
this method of Peace may be more prosperous
then that of War, both to stop the effusion of
bloud, &amp; to close those wounds already made:
and in it I am no less solicitous for my Friends
safety, then mine own; chusing to venture my
Self upon further hazards, rather then expose
their resolute Loyaltie to all extremities.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[page 199]</span>

<p>It is some skil in play to know when a game
is lost; better fairly to give over, then to contest
in vain.</p>

<p>I must now study to re-inforce my Judgment,
and fortifie my mind with Reason and Religion,
that I may not seem to offer up my Souls
libertie, or make my Conscience their Captive;
who ought at first to have used Arguments,
not Arms, to have perswaded my consent to
their demands.</p>

<p>I thank God, no success darkens or disguises
Truth to me; and I shall no less conform my
words to my inward dictates now, then if they
had been as the words of a <span class="sc">King</span> ought to be
among loyal Subjects, <i><b>full of power</b></i>.</p>

<p>Reason is the divinest power. I shall never
think my Self weakned, while I may make full
and free use of that. No ecclipse of outward
Fortune shall rob me of that light: what God
hath denied of outward strength, his grace, I
hope, will supply with inward resolutions; not
morositie to deny, what is fit to be granted; but
not to grant any thing which Reason and Religion
bids me denie.</p>

<p>I shall never think my Self less then my Self,
while I am able thus to preserve the integrity
of my Conscience, the only Jewel now left me,
which is worth keeping.</p>

that trust in him; though the Reeds of <i><b>&AElig;gypt</b></i>

<p>Gods Providence commands Me to retire
from all to himself, that in him I may enjoy
My Self, which I lose, while I let out My hopes

the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wordls'">worlds</ins> vanity and inconstancie.</p>

<p>I care not much to be reckoned among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[page 202]</span>
Unfortunate, if I be not in the black List of irreligious
and sacrilegious Princes.</p>

<p>No Restraint shall ensnare my Soul in sin;
nor gain that of me which may make my Enemies
more insolent, my Friends ashamed, or
my Name accursed.</p>

<p>They have no great cause to triumph, that they
have got my Person into their power; since
my Soul is still my own: nor shall they ever
gain my Consent against my Conscience.</p>

<p>What they call obstinacie, I know God accounts
honest constancie, from which Reason
and Religion, as well as Honor, forbid Me to
recede.</p>

<p>'Tis evident now, that it was not Evil Counsellors
with Me, but a good Conscience in Me,
which hath been fought against; nor did they
ever intend to bring Me to my Parliament, till
they had brought My mind to their obedience.</p>

should be such as they with Me, not more a

have a little of safety to a Prince, yet it hath
not more of danger.</p>

<p>The fear of men shall never be my snare; nor
shal the love of any liberty entangle my soul:

the greatest injuries my Enemies seek to inflict
upon me, cannot be without my own consent.</p>

<p>While I can deny with Reason, I shall defeat
the greatest impressions of their malice, who
neither know how to use worthily what I
have already granted; nor what to require more
of me but this, That I would seem willing to
help them to destroy my self and mine.</p>

<p>Although they should destroy me, yet they
shall have no cause to despise me.</p>

<p>Neither liberty nor life are so dear to me, as
the peace of my Conscience, the Honor of my
Crowns, and the welfare of my People; which
my word may injure more then any War can
do; while I gratifie a few to oppresse all.</p>

<p>The Laws wil by Gods blessing, revive, with
the love and Loyaltie of my Subjects; if I bury
them not by my Consent, and cover them in
that grave of dishonor and injustice, which
some mens violence hath digged for them.</p>

<p>If my Captivity or Death must be the price
of their redemption, I grudge not to pay it.</p>

<p>No condition can make a King miserable,
which carries not with it, his Souls, his Peoples,

<p>After-times may see, what the blindnesse of
this Age will not; and God may at length shew
my Subjects, that I chuse rather to suffer for
them, then with them; happily I might redeem
my self to some shew of liberty, if I would

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">24. <i>Upon their denying His Majestie the Attendance of His Chaplains.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">W</span>
<b>Hen</b> providence was pleased to deprive
Me of all other civil comforts and secular
attendants, I thought the absence of them
all might best be supplied by the attendance of
some of my Chaplains, whom for their Function
I reverence, and for their Fidelitie I have
cause to love. By their Learning, Pietie, and
Praiers, I hoped to be either better enabled to
sustain the want of all other enjoyments, or
better fitted for the recovery and use of them in
Gods good time; so reaping by their pious
help a spiritual harvest of grace amidst the
thorns, and after the plowings of temporal
crosses.</p>

<p>The truth is, I never needed or desired more
the service and assistance of men judiciously
pious, and soberly devout.</p>

<p>The solitude they have confined me unto, adds
the wildernesse to my temptations: For the
company they obtrude upon me, is more sad
then any solitude can be.</p>

<p>If I had asked my Revenues, my power of the
<i><b>Militia</b></i>, or any one of my Kingdoms, it had bin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[page 207]</span>
no wonder to have been denied in those things,
where the evil policy of men forbids all just restitution,
lest they should confess an injurious
usurpation: But to deny me the ghostly comfort
of my Chaplains seems a greater rigor &amp; barbarity,
then is ever used by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'christias'">christians</ins> to the meanest
prisoners, &amp; greatest malefactors, whom though
the justice of the law deprive of worldly comforts,
yet the mercy of religion allows them the
benefit of their Clergy, as not aiming at once
to destroy their Bodies, and to damn their
Souls.</p>

<p>But my agony must not be relieved with the
presence of any one good Angel; for such I account
a learned, godly, and discreet Divine:
and such I would have all mine to be.</p>

<p>They that envie my being a King, are loth I
should be a Christian: while they seek to deprive
me of all things else, they are afraid I
should save my Soul.</p>

<p>Other sense, Charity it self can hardly pick
out of those many harsh repulses I received, as
to that request so often made for the attendance
of some of my Chaplains.</p>

<p>I have sometime thought the Unchristiannes
of those denials might arise from a displeasure
some men had to see me prefer my own
Divines before their Ministers: whom, though
I respect for that worth and piety w<sup>ch</sup> may be
in them, yet I cannot think them so proper for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[page 208]</span>
any present comforters or Physitians, Who
have (some of them at least) had so great an
influence in occasioning these calamities, and
inflicting these wounds upon Me.</p>

<p>Nor are the soberest of them so apt for that
devotional compliance, and juncture of hearts,
which I desire to bear in those holy Offices to
be performed with me, and for me; since their
judgments standing at a distance from me, or
in jealousie of me, or in opposition against me,
their Spirits cannot so harmoniously accord
with mine, or mine with theirs, either in Prayer
or other holy duties, as is meet, and most
comfortable; whose golden rule, and bond of
Perfection consists in that of mutual Love and
Charitie.</p>

<p>Some remedies are worse then the disease,
and some comforters more miserable then misery
it self; when like <i>Job's</i> friends, they seek
not to fortifie ones minde with patience; but
perswade a man by betraying his own Innocency,
to despair of Gods mercy; and by
justifying their injuries, to strengthen the
hands, and harden the heart of insolent Enemies.</p>

<p>I am so much a friend to all Church-men,
that have any thing in them beseeming that
sacred Function, that I have hazarded my
own interests, chiefly upon Conscience and
Constancie, to maintain their Rights; whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[page 209]</span>
the more I looked upon as Orphans, and under
the sacrilegious eyes of many cruell and
rapacious Reformers; so I thought it my dutie
the more to appear as a Father, and a Patron
for them and the Church. Although I am
very unhandsomly requited by some of them;
who may live to repent no lesse for My sufferings,
then their own ungrateful errours, and
that injurious contempt and meannesse, which
they have brought upon their Calling and Persons.</p>

<p>I pity al of them, I despise none: only I thought
I might have leave to make choice of some for
My special Attendance, who were best approved
in My Judgment &amp; most sutable to My affection:
For, I held it better to seem undevout,
and to hear no mans Praiers, then to be forced,
or seem to comply with those Petitions to
which the heart cannot consent, nor the
tongue say <i><b>Amen</b></i>, without contradicting a
mans own understanding, or belying his own
Soul.</p>

<p>In Devotions, I love neither profane boldnesse,
nor pious non-sence; but such an humble
and judicious gravitie as shews the Speaker to
be at once considerate both of Gods Majestie,
the Churches Honour, and his own vilenesse;
both knowing what things God allows him to
ask, and in what manner it becomes a sinner
to supplicate the divine mercie for himself, and
others.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[page 210]</span>

<p>I am equally scandalised with all Praiers,
that sound either imperiously, or rudely, and
passionately; as either wanting humilitie to
God, or charitie to men, or respect to the
dutie.</p>

<p>I confess I am better pleased as with studied
and premeditated Sermons, so with such publick
Forms of Praier, as are fitted to the Churches
and every Christians daily and common
necessities; because I am by them better assured,
what I may join my heart unto, then I can
be of any mans extemporary sufficiencie:
which as I do not wholly exclude from publick
occasions; so I allow its just libertie
and use in private and devout retirements;
where neither the solemnities of the dutie, nor
the modest regards to others, do require so
great exactness as to the outward manner of
performance; Though the light of understanding,
and the fervencie of affections I hold the
main and most necessarie requisites both in
constant, and occasionall, solitairie, and sociall
Devotions.</p>

<p>So that I must needs seem to all equal minds
with as much reason to prefer the service of
my own Chaplains before that of their Ministers,
as I do the Liturgie before their Directorie.</p>

<p>In the one I have been alwaies educated and
exercised; In the other, I am not yet Catechized,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[page 211]</span>
nor acquainted: And if I were, yet
should I not by that, as by any certain rule and
Canon of Devotion, be able to follow or find
out the indirect extravagancies of most of
those men, who highly cry up that as a piece
of rare composure and use, which is already
as much despised and disused by many of them,
as the Common-Prayer sometimes was by
those men; a great part of whose Pietie hung
upon that popular pin of railing against, and
contemning the Government, and Liturgie of
this Church. But, I had rather be condemned
to the wo of <i><b>V&aelig; soli</b></i>, then to that of <i><b>V&aelig; vobis
Hypocrit&aelig;</b></i>, by seeming to pray what I do not
approve.</p>

<p>It may be, I am esteemed by my Denyers
sufficient of my Self to discharge my dutie to
<span class="sc">God</span> as a Priest, though not to Men as a
Prince.</p>

<p>Indeed, I think both Offices, Regal &amp; Sacerdotal,
might well become the same Person; as
anciently they were under one name, and the united
rights of primogeniture: nor could I follow
better presidents, if I were able, then those
two eminent Kings, <i><b>David</b></i> and <i><b>Solomon</b></i>; not
more famous for their Scepters and Crowns,
then one was for devout Psalms and Praiers;
the other for his divine Parables and Preaching:
whence the one merited and assumed
the name of a Prophet, the other of a Preacher.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[page 212]</span>
Titles indeed of greater honour, where
rightly placed, then any of those the Roman
Emperors affected from the Nations they
subdued: it being infinitely more glorious to
convert Souls to Gods Church by the Word,
then to conquer men to a subjection by the
Sword.</p>

<p>Yet since the order of Gods wisdom and
providence hath, for the most part, alwaies
distinguished the gifts and offices of Kings, of
Priests, of Princes and Preachers; both in the
Jewish and Christian Churches: I am sorry to
find My self reduced to the necessity of being
both, or enjoying neither.</p>

<p>For such as seek to deprive Me of Kingly
Power and Soveraigntie; would no lesse
enforce Me to live many Moneths without all
Praiers, Sacraments, and Sermons, unlesse I become
My own Chaplain.</p>

<p>As I owe the Clergy the protection of a Christian
<span class="sc">King</span>, so I desire to enjoy from them the
benefit of their gifts and prayers; which I look
upon as more prevalent then My own, or other
mens; by how much they flow from
minds more enlightned, and affections lesse distracted,
then those which are encombered
with secular affairs: besides, I think a greater
blessing and acceptablenes attends those duties,
which are rightly performed, as proper to, and
within the limits of that calling, to which God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[page 213]</span>
and the Church have specially designed and
consecrated some men: And however, as to
that Spirituall government, by which the
devout Soul is subject to Christ, and through
his merits daily offers it self and its services to
God, every private believer is a King and a
Priest, invested with the honour of a Royall
Priest hood; yet as to Ecclesiastical order, and
the outward policy of the Church, I think confusion
in Religion will as certainly follow every
mans turning Priest or Preacher, as it will
in the State, where every one affects to rule as
King.</p>

<p>I was always bred to more modest, and I
think to more pious Principles: the consciousness
to my spirituall defects makes Me more
prize and desire those pious assistances, which
holy and good Ministers, either Bishops or
Presbyters, may afford Me; especially in these
extremities, to which God hath been pleased to
suffer some of my Subjects to reduce me; so as
to leave them nothing more, but my life to take
from Me: and to leave me nothing to desire,
which I thought might less provoke their jealousie
and offence to deny Me, then this of having
some means afforded Me for my Souls
comfort and support.</p>

<p>To which end I made choice of men, as no
way (that I know) scandalous, so every way
eminent for their learning and piety, no less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[page 214]</span>
then for their Loyalty: nor can I imagine any
exceptions to be made against them, but onely
this, that they may seem too able, and too well
affected toward Me and My Service.</p>

<p>But this is not the first service (as I count it
the best) in which they have forced Me to serve
my self; though I must confess I bear with more
grief and impatience the want of My Chaplains,
then of My other Servants; and next (if
not beyond in some things) to the being sequestred
from My Wife and Children; since
from these indeed more of humane and temporary
affections, but from those more of
heavenly and eternall improvements may be
expected.</p>

<p>My comfort is, that in the enforced (not
neglected) want of ordinary means, God is
wont to afford extraordinary supplies of his
Gifts and Graces.</p>

<p>If his Spirit will teach me, and help my infirmities
in prayer, reading and meditation (as
I hope he will) I shall need no other, either Orator,
or Instructer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>To thee therefore, O my God, do I direct

<h2  style="margin-top: 2em;">26. <i>Upon the Armies surprisall of the King at</i> Holmby, <i>and the ensuing distractions in the two Houses, the Army, and the City.</i></h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">W</span>
<b>Hat</b> part God will have me now to
act or suffer in this new and strange
scene of affaires, I am not much solicitous;
some little practise will serve that man, who
only seeks to represent a part of honesty and
honour.</p>

<p>This surprize of me tels the world, that a
<span class="sc">King</span> cannot be so low, but he is considerable,
adding weight to that party where he
appears.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[page 224]</span>

<p>This motion, like others of the Times, seems
excentrique and irregular, yet not well to be
resisted or quieted: Better swim down such a
stream, then in vain to strive against it.</p>

<p>These are but the struglings of those twins,
which lately one womb enclosed, the younger
striving to prevail against the elder; what the
Presbyterians have hunted after, the Independents
now seek to catch for themselves.</p>

<p>So impossible it is for lines to be drawn from
the center, and not to divide from each other,
so much the wider, by how much they go farther
from the point of union.</p>

<p>That the Builders of Babel should from division
fall to confusion, is no wonder; but for
those that pretend to build Jerusalem, to divide
their tongues and hands, is but an ill Omen;
and sounds too like the fury of those
Zealots, whose intestine bitterness and divisions
were the greatest occasion of the last fatall
destruction of that Citie.</p>

<p>Well may I change my Keepers and Prison,
but not my captive condition, onely with this
hope of bettering, that those who are so much
professed Patrons for the Peoples Liberties,
cannot be utterly against the Liberty of their
<span class="sc">King</span>; what they demand for their own
Consciences, they cannot in Reason deny to
mine.</p>

<p>In this they seem more ingenuous, then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[page 225]</span>
Presbyterian rigour, who sometimes complaining
of exacting their conformity to laws,
are become the greatest Exactours of other
mens submission to their novel injunctions,
before they are stamped with the Authority
of Laws, which they cannot well have without
my Consent.</p>

<p>'Tis a great argument, that the Independents
think themselves manumitted from their Rivals
service, in that they carry on a businesse of
such consequence, as the assuming my Person
into the Armies custody, without any commission,
but that of their own will and power.
Such as will thus adventure on a KING,
must not be thought over-modest, or timerous
to carry on any designe they have a
mind to.</p>

<p>Their next motion menaces, and scares both
the two Houses and the City: which soon after
acting over again that former part of Tumultuary
motions, (never questioned, punished
or repented) must now suffer for both; and
see their former sin in the glasse of the present
terrours and distractions.</p>

<p>No man is so blinde as not to see herein the
hand of divine Justice; They that by Tumults
first occasioned the raising of Armies, must
now be chastned by their own Army for new
Tumults.</p>

<p>So hardly can men be content with one sin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[page 226]</span>
but add sin to sin, till the later punish the former;
such as were content to see Me and many
Members of both Houses driven away by
the first unsuppressed Tumults, are now forced
to flie to an Armie or defend themselves against
them.</p>

<p>But who can unfold the riddle of some mens
justice? The Members of both Houses who at
first withdrew (as my Self was forced to do)
from the rudeness of the Tumults, were counted
Deserters, and outed of their places in Parliament.</p>

<p>Such as stayed then, and enjoyed the benefit
of the Tumults, were asserted for the onely
Parliament-men: now the Fliers from, and
Forsakers of their Places, carry the Parliamentary
power along with them; complain
highly against the Tumults, and vindicate
themselves by an Armie: such as remained and
kept their stations, are looked upon as Abettors
of Tumultuary Insolencies, and Betrayers
of the Freedom and Honour of Parliament.</p>

<p>Thus is Power above all Rule, Order, and
Law; where men look more to present Advantages
then their Consciences, and the unchangeable
rules of Justice; while they are
Judges of others, they are forced to condemn
themselves.</p>

<p>Now the plea against Tumults holds good,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[page 227]</span>
the Authours and Abettors of them are guiltie
of prodigious insolencies; when as before
they were counted as Friends, and necessary
Assistants.</p>

<p>I see Vengeance pursues and overtakes (as
the Mice and Rats are said to have done the Bishop
in <i><b>Germanie</b></i>) them that thought to have
escaped, and fortified themselves most impregnably
against it, both by their multitude and
compliance.</p>

<p>Whom the Laws cannot, God will punish
by their own crimes and hands.</p>

<p>I cannot but observe this divine Justice, yet
with sorrow and pity; for, I always wished so
well to Parliament and Citie, that I was sorry
to see them do or suffer any thing unworthy
such great and considerable Bodies in this
Kingdom.</p>

<p>I was glad to see them onely scared and
humbled, not broken by that shaking: I never
had so ill a thought of those Cities, as to despair
of their Loyaltie to Me; which mistakes
might eclipse, but I never beleeved malice had
quite put out.</p>

<p>I pray God the storm be yet wholly passed
over them, upon whom I look as Christ did
sometime over <i><b>Jerusalem</b></i>, as objects of my
prayers and tears, with compassionate grief,
foreseeing those severer scatterings which will
certainly befall such as wantonly refuse to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[page 228]</span>
gathered to their duty: fatall blindnesse frequently
attending and punishing wilfulnesse,
so that men shall not be able at last to prevent
their sorrows, who would not timely repent of
their sins; nor shall they be suffered to enjoy
the comforts, who securely neglect the counsels
belonging to their peace. They will finde
that brethren in iniquitie are not far from becoming
insolent Enemies, there being nothing
harder then to keep ill men long in one
minde.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible to gain a fair period for
those notions which go rather in a round and
circle of fansie, then in a right line of reason
tending to the Law, the onely center of publike
consistency; whither I pray God at last
bring all sides.</p>

<p>Which will easily be done, when we shall
fully see how much more happie we are, to be
subject to the known Laws, then to the various
wils of any men, seem they never so plausible
at first.</p>

<p>Vulgar compliance with any illegal and extravagant
wayes, like violent motions in nature,
soon grows weary of itself, and ends in
a refractory sullennesse: Peoples rebounds are
oft in their faces, who first put them upon
those violent strokes.</p>

<p>For the Army (which is so far excusable, as
they act according to Souldiers principles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[page 229]</span>
interests, demanding pay and indemnity) I
think it necessary, in order to the publike peace,
that they should be satisfied, as far as is just;
no man being more prone to consider them
then my Self: though they have fought against
Me, yet I cannot but so far esteem that valour
and gallantry they have sometime shewed,
as to wish I may never want such men to
maintain my Self, my Laws, and my Kingdoms,
in such a peace, as wherein they may
enjoy their share and proportion, as much as
any men.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>But thou, O Lord, who art perfect Unity in a
sacred Trinity, in mercy behold those whom thy

<p><b><i>Deliver me from the strivings of my People,

<p>The evidence of which different education
the holy Writ affords us in the contemplation
of <i><b>David</b></i> and <i><b>Rehoboam</b></i>: The one prepared
by many afflictions for a flourishing Kingdom,
the other softned by the unparaleld prosperity
of Solomons Court, and so corrupted to the
great diminution, both for Peace, Honor, and
Kingdom, by those flatteries, which are as
unseparable from prosperous Princes, as Flies
are from fruit in summer; whom adversitie, like
cold weather, drives away.</p>

<p>I had rather you should be <i><b>Charles le Bon</b></i>,
then <i><b>le Grand</b></i>, good then great. I hope God
hath designed you to be both, having so early
put you into that exercise of his Graces, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[page 234]</span>
gifts bestowed upon you, which may best
weed out all vitious inclinations, and dispose
you to those Princely endowments, and employments,
which will most gain the love, and
intend the welfare of those, over whom God
shall place you.</p>

<p>With God I would have you begin and
end, who is King of Kings; the Soveraign
disposer of the Kingdomes of the world,
who pulleth down one, and setteth up another.</p>

<p>The best Government, and highest Soveraignty
you can attain to, is, to be subject to
him, that the Scepter of his Word and Spirit,
may rule in your heart.</p>

<p>The true glory of Princes consists in advancing
Gods Glory in the maintenance of true
Religion, and the Churches good; Also in the
dispensation of civil Power, with Justice and
Honour to the publique peace.</p>

<p>Pietie will make you prosperous; at least it
will keep you from being miserable; nor is he
much a loser, that loseth all, yet saveth his own
soul at last.</p>

<p>To which Center of true happiness, God, I
trust, hath and will graciously direct all these
black lines of affliction, which he hath been
pleased to draw on me, and by which he hath
[I hope] drawn me nearer to himself. You
have already tasted of that Cup whereof I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[page 235]</span>
have liberally drank, which I look upon as
Gods Physick, having that in healthfulness
which it wants in pleasure.</p>

<p>Above all, I would have you, as I hope you
are already, wel-grounded and setled in your
Religion: The best profession of which, I have
ever esteemed that of the church of England,
in which you have been educated; yet I would
have your own Judgment and Reason now
seal to that sacred bond which education hath
written, that it may be judiciously your owne
Religion, and not other mens custome or tradition,
which you profess.</p>

<p>In this I charge you to persevere, as comming
nearest to Gods Word for Doctrine, and
to the primitive examples for Government,
with some little amendment, which I have otherwhere
expressed and often offered, though
in vain. Your fixation in matters of Religion
will not be more necessary for your soul's then
your Kingdoms peace, when God shall bring
you to them.</p>

<p>For I have observed, that the Devill of Rebellion,
doth commonly turn himself into an
Angel of Reformation; and the old Serpent
can pretend new Lights; when some mens
Consciences accuse them for Sedition and Faction,
they stop its mouth with the name and
noise of Religion; when Pietie pleads for
peace and patience, they cry out Zeal.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[page 236]</span>

<p>So that, unless in this point You be well
setled, you shall never want temptations to destroy
you and yours, under pretensions of reforming
matters of Religion; for that seems
even to worst men, as the best and most auspicious
beginning of their worst designs.</p>

<p>Where, besides the Noveltie which is taking
enough with the Vulgar, every one hath an
affectation, by seeming forward to an outward
Reformation of Religion, to be thought zealous,
hoping to cover those irreligious deformities,
wherto they are conscious, by a severity
of censuring other mens opinions or actions.</p>

<p>Take heed of abetting any Factions, or applying
to any publick Discriminations in matters
of Religion, contrary to what is in your
Judgement and the Church well setled: your
partiall adhering, as head, to any one side
gaines you not so great advantages in some
mens hearts (who are prone to be of their kings
Religion) as it loseth you in others, who think
themselves, and their profession first despised,
then persecuted by you. Take such a course as
may either with calmness &amp; charity quite remove
the seeming differences and offences, by
impartiality, or so order affairs in point of power
that you shal not need to fear or flatter any
faction; for if ever you stand in need of them,
or must stand to their curtesie, you are undon:
The Serpent will devour the Dove: you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[page 237]</span>
never expect less of Loyaltie, Justice or humanity,
then from those who engage into religious
Rebellion: Their interest is always made
Gods; under the colours of piety, ambitious
policies march, not onely with greatest security,
but applause, as to the Populacy; you may
hear from them <i>Jacob's</i> voice, but you shall feel
they have <i>Esau</i>'s hands.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed less considerable then the
Presbyterian Faction in <i><b>England</b></i>, for many
yeers; so complyant they were to publique
order: nor indeed was their Party great, either
in Church or State, as to mens judgements:
But as soon as discontents drave men into Sidings
(as ill humors fall to the disaffected part,
which causes inflammations) so did all, at first,
who affected any novelties, adhere to that side,
as the most remarkable and specious note of
difference (then) in point of Religion.</p>

<p>All the lesser Factions at first were officious
servants to Presbytery their great Master: till
time and military success discovering to each
their peculiar advantages, invited them to part
stakes, and leaving the joynt stock of uniform
Religion, pretended each to drive for their
Party, the trade of profits and preferments, to
the breaking and undoing not onely of the
Church and State, but even of Presbytery it
self, which seemed and hoped at first to have
engrossed all.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[page 238]</span>

<p>Let nothing seem little or despicable to you,
in matters which concern Religion, and the
Churches peace, so as to neglect a speedy reforming
and effectual suppressing Errors, and
Schisms, which seem at first but as a hand-bredth,
but by seditious Spirits as by strong
winds are soon made to cover and darken the
whole Heaven.</p>

<p>When you have done justice to God, your
own soul and his Church, in the profession and
preservation both of truth and unitie in Religion.
The next main hinge on which your
prosperitie will depend, and move, is, That of
civil Justice, wherein the setled Laws of these
Kingdoms, to which you are rightly heir, are
the most excellent rules you can govern by;
which by an admirable temperament give very
much to Subjects industry, libertie, and happiness;
and yet reserve enough to the Majestie
and Prerogative of any King, who owns his
people as Subjects, not as slaves; whose subjection,
as it preserves their propertie, peace,
and safetie; so it will never diminish your
Rights, nor their ingenuous Liberties; which
consists in the enjoyment of the fruits of their
industry, and the benefit of those Laws to
which themselves have consented.</p>

<p>Never charge your Head with such a
Crown, as shall by its heaviness oppress the
whole body, the weakness of whose parts cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[page 239]</span>
return any thing of strength, honor, or
safety, to the Head, but a necessary debilitation
and ruine.</p>

<p>Your Prerogative is best shewed, and exercised
in remitting, rather then exacting the rigor
of the Laws, there being nothing worse, then
legal tyrannie.</p>

<p>In these two points, the preservation of established
Religion and Laws, I may (without
vanity) turn the reproach of my sufferings, as
to the worlds censure, into the honor of a
kinde of Martyrdom, as to the testimony of
my own Conscience. The troublers of my
Kingdoms having nothing else to object against
me but this, That I prefer Religion, and Laws
established, before those alterations they propounded.</p>

<p>And so indeed I do, and ever shall, till I am
convinced by better Arguments, then what
hitherto have been chiefly used towards me,
Tumults, Armies, and Prisons.</p>

<p>I cannot yet learn that lesson, nor I hope
ever will you, That it is safe for a King to gratifie
any Faction with the perturbation of the
Laws, in which is wrapt up the publike Interest,
and the good of the communitie.</p>

<p>How God will deal with me, as to the removal
of these pressures, and indignities, which
his justice by the very unjust hands of some
of my Subjects, hath been pleased to lay upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[page 240]</span>
me, I cannot tell: nor am I much solicitous
what wrong I suffer from men, while I retain
in my soul, what I believe is right before
God.</p>

<p>I have offered all for Reformation and Safety,
that in Reason, Honor and Conscience,
I can; reserving onely what I cannot consent
unto, without an irreparable injury to my own
soul, the Church, and my people, and to you
also; as the next and undoubted Heir of my
Kingdoms.</p>

<p>To which, if the divine Providence, to whom
no difficulties are insuperable, shall in his due
time after my decease bring you, as I hope he
will: My Counsel and Charge to you, is,
That you seriously consider the former real or
objected miscarriages, which might occasion
my troubles, that you may avoyd them.</p>

<p>Never repose so much upon any mans single
counsel, fidelity, and discretion, in managing
affairs of the first magnitude, (that is, matters
of Religion and Justice) as to create in your
self, or others, a diffidence of your own judgment,
which is likely to be always more constant
and impartial to the interest of your
Crown and Kingdom then any mans.</p>

<p>Next, beware of exasperating any Factions
by the crossness, and asperity of some mens
passions, humors, or private opinions, imployed
by you, grounded onely upon the differences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[page 241]</span>
in lesser matters, which are but the
skirts and suburbs of Religion.</p>

<p>Wherein a charitable connivence and Christian
toleration often dissipates their strength,
whom rougher opposition fortifies; and puts
the despised and oppressed party, into such
Combinations, as may most enable them to
get a full revenge on those they count their
Persecutors, who are commonly assisted by
that vulgar commiseration, which attends all,
that are said to suffer under the notion of Religion.</p>

<p>Provided the differences amount not to an
insolent opposition of Laws, and Government,
or Religion established, as to the essentials
of them, such motions and minings are intolerable.</p>

<p>Alwaies keep up solid piety, and those fundamental
Truths (which mend both hearts
and lives of men) with impartial Favour and
Justice.</p>

<p>Take heed that outward circumstances and
formalities of Religion devoure not all, or
the best incouragements of learning, industry,
and piety; but with an equal eye and impartial
hand, distribute Favours and Rewards to all
men, as you find them for their real goodnesse
both in abilities and fidilitie worthy and capable
of them.</p>

<p>This will be sure to gain you the hearts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[page 242]</span>
the best and the most too: who though they be
not good themselves, yet are glad to see the
severer ways of vertue at any time sweetned
by temporall rewards.</p>

<p>I have, You see, conflicted with different and
opposite Factions (for so I must needs call and
count all those that act not in any conformity
to the Laws established in Church and State;)
no sooner have they by force subdued what
they counted their common Enemy (that is,
all those that adhered to the Laws, and to Me)
and are secured from that fear, but they are
divided to so high a rivalry, as sets them more
at defiance against each other, then against
their first Antagonists.</p>

<p>Time will dissipate all Factions, when once
the rough horns of private mens covetous and
ambitious designes shall discover themselves;
which were at first wrapt up and hidden under
the soft and smooth pretensions of Religion,
Reformation and Liberty. As the Wolf is not
less cruell, so he wil be more justly hated, when
he shall appear no better then a Wolf under
Sheeps cloathing.</p>

<p>But as for the seduced Train of the Vulgar,
who in their simplicity follow those disguises;
My Charge and Counsell to You, is,
That as you need no palliations for any Designes,
(as other men) so that you study really
to exceed [in true and constant demonstrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[page 243]</span>
of goodness, piety, and vertue towards
the people] even all those men that make the
greatest noise and ostentations of Religion; so
you shall neither fear any detection (as they
do who have but the face and mask of goodness)
nor shall you frustrate the just expectations
of your people; who cannot in Reason
promise themselves so much good from any
Subjects novelties, as from the vertuous constancy
of their King.</p>

<p>When these mountains of congealed Factions
shall by the Sun-shine of Gods Mercy,
and the splendor of your Vertues, be thawed
and dissipated; and the abused Vulgar shall
have learned, that none are greater Oppressours
of their Estates, Liberties, and
Consciences, then those men that intitle
themselves The Patrons and Vindicators of
them, only to usurp power over them: Let
then no passion betray You to any study
of revenge upon those, whose own sin and
folly will sufficiently punish them in due
time.</p>

<p>But as soon as the forked arrow of factious
emulations is drawn out, use all Princely arts
and clemency to heal the wounds; that the
smart of the cure may not equall the anguish
of the hurt.</p>

<p>I have offered Acts of Indemnity and
Oblivion to so great a latitude, as may include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[page 244]</span>
all, that can but suspect themselves to be
any way obnoxious to the Laws; and which
might serve to exclude al future jealousies and
insecurities.</p>

<p>I would have You alwaies propense to the
same way, when ever it shall be desired and accepted,
let it be granted, not only as an Act of
State-policie and necessitie, but of Christian
charitie and choice.</p>

<p>It is all I have now left Me, a power to forgive
those that have deprived Me of all; and I
thank God, I have a heart to do it, and joy as
much in this grace, which God hath given Me,
as in all My former enjoyments; for this is a
greater argument of Gods love to Me, then
any prosperitie can be.</p>

<p>Be confident (as I am) that the most of all
sides, who have done amiss, have done so, not
out of malice, but mis-information, or mis-apprehension
of things.</p>

<p>None will be more loyal and faithful to Me
and You, then those Subjects, who sensible of
their Errors, and our Injuries, will feel
in their own Souls most vehement motives
to repentance, and earnest desires to
make some reparations for their former defects.</p>

<p>As Your qualitie sets You beyond any Duel
with any Subject, so the Nobleness of Your
mind must raise You above the meditating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[page 245]</span>
any revenge, or executing Your anger upon
the many.</p>

<p>The more conscious You shall be to Your
Own Merits upon Your people, the more
prone You will be to expect all love and loyalty
from them, and to inflict no punishment
upon them for former miscarriages: You will
have more inward complacency in pardoning
one, then in punishing a thousand.</p>

<p>This I write to You, not despairing of Gods
Mercy, and My Subjects Affections towards
You, both which, I hope You will study to deserve,
yet We cannot merit of God, but by his
own mercy.</p>

<p>If God shall see fit to restore Me, and You
after Me, to those enjoyments, which the Laws
have assigned to Us, and no Subjects without
an high degree of guilt and sin can devest Us
of, then may I have better opportunity, when
I shall be so happy to see You in peace, to let
You more fully understand the things that belong
to Gods glory, Your own honor, and the
Kingdoms peace.</p>

<p>But if You never see My face again, and
God will have me buried in such a barbarous
Imprisonment &amp; obscurity, [which the perfecting
some mens designs requires] wherin few
hearts that love Me are permitted to exchange
a word, or a look with Me; I do require and
entreat You as Your Father, and Your <span class="sc">King</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[page 246]</span>
that you never suffer your heart to receive the
least check against or disaffection from the
true Religion established in the Church of
<i><b>England</b></i>.</p>

<p>I tell you I have tried it, and after much
search, and many disputes, have concluded it
to be the best in the world, not only in the
Community, as Christian, but also in the speciall
notion, as Reformed, keeping the middle
way between the pomp of superstitious Tyranny,
and the meanness of fantastique Anarchy.</p>

<p>Not but that (the draught being excellent as
to the main, both for Doctrine and Government,
in the Church of <i><b>England</b></i>) some lines,
as in very good figures, may happily need some
sweetning, or polishing, which might here have
easily been done by a safe and gentle hand: if
some mens precipitancy had not violently demanded
such rude alterations, as would have
quite destroyed all the beauty and proportions
of the whole.</p>

<p>The scandall of the late Troubles, which
some may object, and urge to you against the
Protestant Religion established in <i><b>England</b></i>,
is easily answered to them, or your own
thoughts in this; That scarce any one who
hath been a Beginner, or an active Prosecutor
of this late Warr against the Church, the
Laws, and me, either was, or is a true Lover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[page 247]</span>
Embracer or practiser of the Protestant Religion
established in <i><b>England</b></i> which neither
gives such rules, nor ever before set such examples.</p>

<p>'Tis true, some heretofore had the boldness
to present threatning Petitions to their Princes
and Parliaments, which others of the same
Faction (but of worse Spirits) have now put in
execution: but let not counterfeit and disorderly
Zeal abate your value and esteem of true
piety; both of them are to be known by their
fruits; the sweetness of the Vine and Fig-tree
is not be despised, though the brambles and
thorns should pretend to bear figs and grapes,
thereby to rule over the trees.</p>

<p>Nor would I have you to entertain any aversation
or dislike of Parliaments, which in
their right constitution with freedom and honour
will never injure or diminish your greatnesse;
but will rather be as interchangings of
love, loyaltie and confidence betwen a Prince
and his People.</p>

<p>Nor would the events of this black Parliament
have been other then such (however
much biassed by Factions in the Elections) if
it had been preserved from the insolencies of
popular dictates, and tumultuary impressions:
The sad effects of which will no doubt
make all Parliaments after this, more cautious
to preserve that Freedom and Honour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[page 248]</span>
which belong to such Assemblies (when once
they have fully shaken off this yoak of Vulgar
encroachment) since the publick interest consists
in the mutual and common good both of
Prince and People.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more happie for all, then in
fair, grave, and honourable waies to contribute
their Councels in Common, enacting all
things by publick consent, without Tyrannie
or Tumults. We must not starve our selves, because
some men have surfeited of wholesome
food.</p>

<p>And if neither I, nor you, be ever restored
to our Rights, but God in his severest justice,
will punish My Subjects with continuance in
their sin, and suffer them to be deluded with
the prosperity of their wickednesse; I hope
God will give Me and You, that grace, which
will teach and enable Us, to want, as well as to
wear a Crown, which is not worth taking up,
or enjoying upon sordid, dishonourable, and
irreligious terms.</p>

<p>Keep you to true Principles of Piety, vertue,
and honour, You shall never want a Kingdom.</p>

<p>A principal Point of Your honour will consist
in Your referring all respect, love, and
protection to Your Mother, My Wife; who
hath many waies deserved well of Me, and
chiefly in this, That having been a means to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[page 249]</span>
bless me with so many hopeful Children;
(all which, with their Mother, <i>I</i> recommend
to Your love and care) Shee hath been content
with incomparable magnanimity and patience
to suffer both for, and with Me, and
You.</p>

<p>My Prayer to God almightie is, (whatever
becomes of me, who am <i>I</i> thank God, wrapt
up and fortified in my own innocency, and
his Grace) that he would be pleased to make
You an Anchor, or Harbour rather, to these
tossed and weather-beaten Kingdoms; a Repairer
by Your wisdom, justice, piety, and valour,
of what the folly and wickednesse of
some men have so far ruined, as to leave nothing
intire in Church or State, to the Crown,
the Nobility, the Clergie, or the Commons, either
as to Laws, Liberties, Estates, Order, Honour,
Conscience or lives.</p>

<p>When they have destroyed me, (for I know
not how far God may permit the malice and
crueltie of my Enemies to proceed, and such
apprehensions some mens words and actions
have already given me) as <i>I</i> doubt not but my
bloud will cry aloud for vengeance to Heaven:
so I beseech God not to pour out his wrath
upon the generality of the people, who have
either deserted me, or engaged against me,
through the artifice and hypocrisie of their
Leaders, whose inward horrour will be their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[page 250]</span>
first Tormentor, nor will they escape exemplary
judgements.</p>

<p>For those that loved me, I pray God, they
may have no miss of me, when I am gone; so
much I wish and hope, that all good Subjects
may be satisfied with the blessings of your
presence and vertues.</p>

<p>For those that repent of any defects in their
duty toward me, as I freely forgive them in
the word of a Christian <span class="sc">King</span>, so I beleeve
you will find them truly Zealous, to repay
with interest that loyalty and love to you,
which was due to me.</p>

<p>In summe, what good I intended, do you
perform, when God shall give you power;
much good I have offered, more I purposed
to Church and State, if times had been capable
of it.</p>

<p>The deception will soon vanish, and the
Vizards will fall off apace; This mask of Religion
on the face of Rebellion (for so it now
plainly appears, since my Restraint and cruell
usage, that they fought not for me, as was pretended)
wil not long serve to hide some mens
deformities.</p>

<p>Happy times I hope, attend you, wherein
your Subjects [by their miseries] will have
learned, That Religion to their God, and Loyalty
to their King, cannot be parted without
both their sin and their infelicity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[page 251]</span>
I pray God bless you and establish your Kingdoms
in righteousness, your Soul in true Religion, and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'you'">your</ins> honour in the love of God and
your people.</p>

<p>And if God will have disloyalty perfected
by my destruction; let my Memory ever, with
my Name, live in you; as of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'you'">your</ins> Father, that
loves you, and once a <span class="sc">King</span> of three flourishing
Kingdoms; whom God thought fit to
honour, not only with the Scepter and Government
of them, but also with the suffering many
indignities and an untimely death for them;
while I studied to preserve the Rights of the
Church, the Power of the Laws, the Honour
of my Crown, the Priviledge of Parliaments,
the Liberties of my People, and my own Conscience,
which, I thank God, is dearer to me
then a thousand Kingdoms.</p>

<p>I know God can, I hope he yet will restore
me to my Rights. I cannot despair either of
his mercy, or of my peoples love and pitie.</p>

<p>At worst, I trust I shall but go before you to
a better Kingdom, which God hath prepared
for me, and me for it, through my Saviour Jesus
Christ, to whose mercies I commend You
and all mine.</p>

<p>Farewell, till we meet, if not on Earth, yet
in Heaven.</p>

are dispelled; and the special horrour of it,
as to My particular, much allayed: for although
My Death at present may justly be represented
to Me with all those terrible aggravations,
which the policy of cruel and implacable
enemies can put upon it (affaires being
drawn to the very dregs of malice) yet I bless
God, I can look upon all those stings, as unpoysonous,
though sharp; since My Redeemer
hath either pulled them out, or given
Me the Antidote of his Death against them,
which as to the immaturity, injustice, shame,
scorn, and cruelty of it, exceeded what ever I
can fear.</p>

<p>Indeed, I never did find so much, the life of
Religion, the feast of a good Conscience, and
the brazen wall of a judicious integrity and
constancy, as since I came to these closer conflicts
with the thoughts of Death.</p>

<p>I am not so old, as to be wearie of life; nor
(I hope) so bad, as to be either afraid to die,
or ashamed to live: true, I am so afflicted, as
might make Me sometime even desire to die,
if I did not consider, That it is the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[page 254]</span>
glory of a Christians life to <i>die daily</i>, in conquering
by a lively faith, and patient hopes of
a better life, those partiall and quotidian
deaths, which kill us (as it were) by piece-meales,
and make us overlive our own fates:
while we are deprived of health, honour, liberty,
power, credit, safety, or estate; and
those other comforts of dearest relations,
which are as the life of our lives.</p>

<p>Though, as a <span class="sc">King</span>, I think My self to live
in nothing temporall so much, as in the love
and good-will of my People; for which, as I
have suffered many deaths, so I hope I am not
in that point as yet wholly dead: notwithstanding;
My Enemies have used all the poyson
of falsity and violence of hostility to destroy,
first the love and Loyalty, which is in
my Subjects; and then all that content of life
in me, which from these I chiefly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Indeed, they have left me but <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lttle'">little</ins> of life,
and only the husk and shell (as it were) which
their further malice and cruelty can take from
me; having bereaved me of all those worldly
comforts, for which life it self seems desirable
to men.</p>

<p>But, O my Soul! think not that life too
long, or tedious, wherein God gives thee any
opportunities, if not to do, yet to suffer with
such Christian patience and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'magnaminity'">magnanimity</ins>, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[page 255]</span>
a good Cause, as are the greatest honour of
our lives, and the best improvement of our
deaths.</p>

<p><i>I</i> know that in point of true Christian valor,
it argues pusillanimity to desire to dye out
of weariness of life, and a want of that heroick
greatness of Spirit which becoms a Christian
in the patient and generous sustaining
those afflictions, which as shadows necessarily
attend us, while we are in this body: and
which are lessned or enlarged as the Sun of our
prosperity moves higher, or lower: whose totall
absence is best recompensed with the
Dew of Heaven.</p>

<p>The assaults of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'afflicton'">affliction</ins> may be terrible,
like <i><b>Sampsons</b></i> Lyon, but they yeild much sweetness
to those that dare to encounter and overcome
them; who know how to overlive the
witherings of their Gourds without discontent
or peevishness, while they may yet converse
with God.</p>

<p>That <i>I</i> must die as a man, is certain; that <i>I</i>
may die a King, by the hands of my own Subjects,
a violent, sodain, barbarous death; in
the strength of my years, in the midst of my
Kingdoms; my <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Freinds'">Friends</ins> and loving Subjects
being helpless Spectators; my Enemies insolent
Revilers and Triumphers over me, living,
dying, and dead, is so probable in humane reason,
that God hath taught me not to hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[page 256]</span>
otherwise as to mans crueltie; however, I despair
not of Gods infinite mercy.</p>

<p>I know my life is the Object of the devils &amp;
wicked mens malice, but yet under Gods sole
custodie and disposal: whom I do not think to
flatter for longer life by seeming prepared to
die; but I humbly desire to depend upon him,
and to submit to his will both in life and death,
in what order soever he is pleased to lay them
out to me. I confess it is not easie for me to
contend with those many horrours of Death,
wherewith God suffers me to be tempted;
which are equally horrid, either in the suddennesse
of a barbarous Assasination or in those
greater formalities, whereby my Enemies [being
more solemnly cruel] will, it may be,
seek to adde [as those did who Crucified
Christ] the mockery of Justice, to the cruelty
of malice: That I may be destroyed, as with
greater pomp and artifice, so with less pity,
will be but a necessary policie to make my
Death appear as an Act of Justice, done by subjects
upon their Soveraign, who know that no
Law of God or Man invests them with any
power of Judicature without me, much lesse against
me: and who, being sworn, and bound
by all that is sacred before God and man, to
endeavour my preservation, must pretend Justice
to cover their perjury.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, a sad fate for any man to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[page 257]</span>
his Enemies to be Accusers, Parties, and
Judges; but most desperate, when this is
acted by the insolence of Subjects against their
Soveraign; wherein those, who have had
the cheifest hand, and are most <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'guitly'">guilty</ins> of contriving
the publick Troubles, must by shedding
my bloud, seem to wash their own hands
of that innocent bloud whereof they are now
most evidently guilty before God and Man;
and I beleeve in their own Consciences too,
while they carried on unreasonable Demands,
First by Tumults, after by Armies. Nothing
makes mean spirits more cowardly-cruel in
managing their usurped power against their
lawful Superiours then this, the <i><b>guilt of their
unjust Usurpation</b></i>: notwithstanding those specious
&amp; popular pretentions of Justice against
Delinquents applied only to disguise at first
the monstrousnesse of their designs, who despaired,
indeed, of possessing the power and
profits of the Vineyard, till the heir whose right
it is, be cast out and slain.</p>

<p>With them My greatest fault must be, that
I would not either destroy My Self with the
Church and State by My word, or not suffer
them to do it un-resisted by the Sword; whose
covetous ambition no Concessions of Mine
could ever yet either satisfie, or abate.</p>

<p>Nor is it likely they will ever think, that
Kingdom of brambles which some men seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[page 258]</span>
to erect (at once weak, sharp, and fruitlesse,
either to God or man) is like to thrive till watered
with the Royal bloud of those, whose
right the Kingdom is.</p>

<p>Well, Gods will be done, I doubt not but
my Innocencie will finde him both my Protector
and my Advocate, who is my only Judg;
whom I own as King of Kings, not onely for
the eminency of his Power and Majestie above
them; but also for that singular care and protection
which he hath over them; who knows
them to be exposed to as many dangers (being
the greatest patrons of Law, Justice, Order, and
Religion on earth) as there be either Men or
Devils, which love confusion.</p>

<p>Nor will he suffer those men long to
prosper in their <i><b>Babel</b></i>, who build it with
the bones, and cement it with the bloud of
their Kings.</p>

<p>I am confident they will find Avengers of my
death among themselves: the injuries I have
sustained from them shall be first punished by
them, who agreed in nothing so much as in
opposing me.</p>

<p>Their impatience to bear the loud cry of my
bloud, shall make them think no way better to
expiate it, then by shedding theirs, who with
them most thirsted after mine.</p>

<p>The sad confusions following my destruction,
are already presaged and confirmed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[page 259]</span>
me by those I have lived to see since my troubles;
in which God alone (who only could)
hath many ways pleaded my cause; not suffering
them to go unpunished, whose confederacy
in sin was their only security; who have
cause to fear that God will both further divide
and by mutuall vengeance, afterward destroy
them.</p>

<p>My greatest conquest of death is from the
power and love of Christ, who hath swallow'd
up death in the Victory of his Resurection,
and the Glory of his Ascention.</p>

<p>My next comfort is, that he gives me not only
the honour to imitate his example in suffering
for righteousness sake (though obscur'd by
the foulest charges of Tyranny and Injustice,)
but also, that charity, which is the noblest revenge
upon, and victory over my Destroyers:
By which, I thank God, I can both forgive
them and pray for them, that God would not
impute my blood to them, further then to
convince them, what need they have of Christs
bloud to wash their souls from the guilt of
shedding mine.</p>

<p>At present, the will of mine Enemies seems
to be their only rule, their power the measure,
and their Successe the Exactor, of what they
please to call Justice, while they flatter themselves
with the fancy of their own safety by
my danger, and the security of their lives designs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[page 260]</span>
by My Death: forgetting, That as the
greatest temptations to sin are wrapped up in
seeming prosperities, so the severest vengeances
of God are then most accomplished, when
men are suffered to compleat their wicked purposes.</p>

<p>I bless God, I Pray not so much, that this
bitter Cup of violent Death may pass from
Me, as that of his wrath may pass from al those,
whose hands by deserting Me, are sprinkled, or
by Acting and Consenting to My Death are
embrued with My Bloud.</p>

<p>The will of God hath confined, and concluded
Mine; I shall have the pleasure of Dying,
without any pleasure of desired vengeance.</p>

<p>This I think becomes a Christian toward his
Enemies, and a King toward His Subjects.</p>

<p>They cannot deprive Me of more then I am
content to lose, when God sees fit by their
hands to take it from Me; whose mercy I beleive,
will more then infinitely recompence
what ever by mans injustice, he is pleased to
deprive Me of.</p>

<p>The glory attending My Death, will far surpass
all I could enjoy, or conceive in life.</p>

<p>I shall not want the heavy and envyed
Crowns of this world, when My God hath
mercifully Crowned and Consummated his
graces with Glory, and exchanged the shadows
of My earthly Kingdoms among men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[page 261]</span>
for the substance of that Heavenlie Kingdom
with himself.</p>

<p>For the censures of the world; I know the
sharp and necessarie tyrannie of My Destroyers
will sufficiently confute the calumnies of
tyrannie against Me; I am perswaded I am
happie in the judicious love of the ablest and
best of My Subjects, who do not only Pitie and
Pray for Me, but would be content even to die
with Me, or for Me.</p>

<p>These know how to excuse My failings, as a
man, and yet to retain and pay their dutie to
Me, as their King; there being no religious necessitie
binding any Subjects by pretending to
punish, infinitely to exceed the faults and errors
of their Princes, especially there, where
more then sufficient satisfaction hath been
made to the Publick; the enjoyment of which,
private ambitions have hitherto frustrated.</p>

<p>Others, I beleeve, of softer tempers, and
less advantaged by My ruine, do alreadie feel
sharp convictions, and some remorse in their
Consciences: where they cannot but see the
proportions of their evil dealings against Me
in the measure of Gods retaliations upon
them, who cannot hope long to enjoy their
own thumbs and toes, having under pretence
of paring others nails bin so cruel as to cut off
their cheifest strength.</p>

<p>The punishment of the more insolent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[page 262]</span>
obstinate, may be like that of <i><b>Korah</b></i> and his
complices (at once mutining against both Prince
and Priest) in such a method of divine justice, as
is not ordinary, the earth of the lowest and
meanest people opening upon them, and swallowing
them up in a just disdain of their ill-gotten,
and worse used Authority: upon whose
support and strength they chiefly depended for
their building and establishing their designes
against Me, the Church and State.</p>

<p>My chiefest comfort in death consists in my
peace, which I trust, is made with <span class="sc">God</span>; before
whose exact Tribunall I shall not fear to
appear, as to the Cause so long disputed by
the Sword, between me and my causelese Enemies,
where I doubt not but his righteous
Judgment will confute their fallacy, who from
worldly success (rather like Sophisters, then
sound Christians) draw those popular conclusions
for Gods approbation of their actions;
whose wise providence (we know) oft
permits many events which his revealed word
(the only clear, safe, and fixed rule of good
actions and good consciences) in no sort approves.</p>

<p>I am confident, the justice of my Cause, and
clearness of my Conscience before God, and
toward my people, wil carry me as much above
them in Gods decision, as their Successes have
lifted them above me in the Vulgar opinion:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[page 263]</span>
who consider not, that many times those undertakings
of men are lifted up to heaven in the
prosperity and applause of the world, whose
rise is from hell, as to the injuriousness and
oppression of the design. The prosperous winds
which oft fil the sails of Pirats, doth not justifie
their piracy and rapine.</p>

<p>I look upon it with infinite more content
and quiet of Soul, to have been worsted in my
enforced contestation for, and vindication
of the Laws of the Land, the Freedom and
Honour of Parliaments, the Rights of my
Crown, the just Liberty of my Subjects, and
the true Christian Religion in its Doctrine,
Government, and due Encouragements, then
if I had, with the greatest advantages of success
over-born them all; as some men have
now evidently done, whatever designes they
at first pretended.</p>

<p>The prayers and patience of my Friends and
loving Subjects will contribute much to the
sweetning of this bitter cup, which I doubt not
but I shall more cheerfully take and drink, as
from Gods hand (if it must be so) then they
can give it to me, whose hands are unjustly and
barbarously lifted up against Me.</p>

<p>And as to the last event, I may seem to
owe more to my Enemies then my Friends;
while those will put a period to the sins and
sorrows attending this miserable life, wherewith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[page 264]</span>
these desire, I might still contend.</p>

<p>I shall be more then Conquerour through,
Christ enabling me: for whom <i>I</i> have hitherto
suffered, as he is the Author of Truth,
Order, and Peace; for all which <i>I</i> have been
forced to contend against Errour, Faction, and
confusion.</p>

<p>If <i>I</i> must suffer a violent death with my Saviour;
it is but mortality crowned with martyrdom:
where the debt of death, which I owe
for sin to nature, shall be raised as a gift of faith
and patience offered to God.</p>

<p>Which <i>I</i> humbly beseech him mercifully to
accept; and although death be the wages of
my own sinne, as from God, and the effect
of others sinnes, as men, both against God and
me; yet as <i>I</i> hope my own sinnes are so remitted,
that they shall be no ingredients to imbitter
the cup of my death, so <i>I</i> desire God to
pardon their sins, who are most guilty of my
destruction.</p>

<p>The Trophees of my charitie will be more
glorious and durable over them, then their ill
managed victories over me.</p>

<p>Though their sin be prosperous, yet they had
need to be penitent, that they may be pardoned:
Both which, <i>I</i> pray God they may obtain:
that my temporal Death unjustly inflicted
by them, may not be revenged by Gods just
inflicting eternal death upon them: for <i>I</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[page 265]</span>
look upon the temporall destruction of the
greatest King, as far lesse deprecable then the
eternall damnation of the meanest Subject.</p>

<p>Nor do I wish other then the safe bringing
of the ship to shore, when they have cast me
overboard; though it be very strange, that Mariners
can finde no other means to appease the
storms themselves have raised, but by drowning
their Pilot.</p>

<p>I thank God, my Enemies cruelty cannot
prevent my preparation; whose malice in this
I shall defeat, that they shall not have the satisfaction
to have destroyed my Soul with my
Body; of whose salvation, while some of them
have themselves seemed, and taught others to
despair, they have onely discovered this, that
they do not much desire it.</p>

<p>Whose uncharitable and cruell Restraints,
denying me even the assistance of any of my
Chaplains, hath rather enlarged, then any
way obstructed my accesse to the Throne of
Heaven,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b><i>Where thou dwellest, O King of Kings, who fillest

<b> Powerfull and Eternall God!</b> to whom
nothing is so great, that it may resist; or
so small, that it is contemned; look upon my
miserie with thine eye of mercy, and let Thine
infinite power vouchsafe to limit out some
proportion of deliverance unto me, as to Thee
shall seem most convenient; let not Injurie, O

of Jesus Christ, in whom thou art only wel
pleased: for of my Self I am not worthy to
stand before thee, or to speak with my unclean
lips to thee, most holy and eternall God;
for as in sin I was conceived and born, so

heavie Displeasure: as for my sins, O Lord, they
are innumerable: wherefore I stand here liable
to all the miseries in this life, and everlasting
Torments in that to come, if thou shouldst
deal with me according to my deserts. I confesse,
O Lord, that it is thy Mercie (which endureth
for ever) and thy compassion (which
never fails) which is the cause that I have not
been long ago consumed: but with thee there
is Mercie and plenteous Redemption; in the
multitude therefore of thy mercies, and by the
Merits of Jesus Christ, I intreat thy Divine
Majestie, that thou wouldst not enter into judgment
with thy servant, nor be extreme to mark
what is done amisse, but be thou mercifull
unto Me, and wash away all my sins with that
precious bloud that my Saviour shed for me.
And I beseech thee, O Lord, not onely to wash
away all my sins; but also to purge my heart
by thy holy Spirit, from the dross of my natural
corruption: And as thou dost add days to my
life, so good Lord, I beseech thee to add repentance
to my dayes, that when I have past this
mortall life, I may be partaker of thy everlasting
Kingdom, through the Merits of Jesus
Christ our Lord, <i><b>Amen</b></i>.</p>

<b>Lmighty and most mercifull Father</b>, as it
is onely thy Goodnesse that admits of our
imperfect Prayers, and the knowledge that
thy mercies are infinite, which can give Us any
hope of thy accepting or granting them:
so it is our bounden and necessary duty to confesse
our sins freely unto thee; And of all men
living, I have most need, most reason so to do;
no man having been so much obliged by thee,
no man more grievously offending thee: that
degree of knowledge which thou hast given
me adding likewise to the guilt of my transgressions.
For, was it through ignorance, that
I suffered innocent bloud to be shed by a false
pretended way of Justice? or that I permitted
a wrong way of thy Worship to be set up
in <i><b>Scotland?</b></i> and injured the Bishops in <i><b>England?</b></i>
O no; but with shame and grief I confesse,
that I therein followed the perswasions
of worldly Wisdome, forsaking the Dictates
of a right-informed Conscience: Wherefore,
O Lord, I have no excuse to make, no hope
left, but in the multitude of thy mercies; for
I know my repentance weak, and my prayers
faulty: Grant therefore, mercifull Father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[page 277]</span>
so to strengthen my repentance, and amend
my prayers, that thou maist clear the way
for thine own mercies; to which, O let thy
Justice at last give place, putting a speedy
end to my deserved afflictions. In the mean
time, give me patience to endure, Constancy
against Temptations, and a discerning spirit,
to chuse what is best for thy Church, and People
which thou hast committed to my charge.

thy Son Jesus Christs sake, our onely Saviour,

first gave his blessing to the Lady <i>Elisabeth</i>;
and bad her remember to tell her Brother
<i><b>James</b></i>, when ever she should see him, That
it was his Fathers last desire, that he should no
more look upon <i><b>Charles</b></i> as his eldest Brother
only, but be obedient unto him, as his Soveraign;
and that they should love one another,
and forgive their Fathers Enemies. Then said
the King to her, Sweet-heart you'l forget this:
No (said she) <i>I</i> shall never forget it while I
live: And pouring forth abundance of Tears,
promised him to write down the Paticulars.</p>

<p>Then the King taking the Duke of <i><b>Glocester</b></i>
upon his knee, said, Sweet-heart, now they will
cut off thy Fathers head; (upon which words
the child looked very stedfastly on him.) Mark
child, what I say, they will cut of my head, and
perhaps make thee a King: But mark what I
say, you must not be a King so long as your
Brother <i><b>Charles</b></i> and <i><b>James</b></i> do live; For they
will cut off your Brothers heads, (when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[page 281]</span>
can catch them) and cut off thy head too at the
last: and therefore, <i>I</i> charge you, do not be
made a King by them. At which the child, sighing,
said, I will be torn in pieces first. Which
falling so unexpectedly from one so young, it
made the King rejoyce exceedingly.</p>

twentieth of <i><b>January</b></i> 1648. being the
last time I had the happiness to see him; he
told me, he was glad I was come, and although
he had not time to say much, yet somewhat
he had to say to me, which he had not to another,
or leave in writing, because he feared
their cruelty was such, as that they would not
have permitted him to write to me, he wished
me not to grieve and torment my self for him;
for that would be a glorious death that he
should dye; it being for the Laws and Liberties
of this Land, and for maintaining the true
Protestant Religion. He bad me read Bishop
<i><b>Andrews</b></i> Sermons, <i><b>Hookers Ecclesiasticall
Politie</b></i>, and Bishop <i><b>Lauds</b></i> Book against <i><b>Fisher</b></i>,
which would ground me against Popery.
He told me, he had forgiven all his Enemies,
and hoped God would forgive them also; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[page 282]</span>
commanded us, and all the rest of my Brothers
and Sisters to forgive them: he bid me tell my
Mother, That his thoughts never had strayed
from her, and that his love should be the same
to the last. Withall he commanded me and my
Brother to be obedient to her. And bid me
send his blessing to the rest of my Brothers
and Sisters, with Commendation to all His
Friends: So after he had given me his blessing,
I took my leave.</p>

<p>Further, he commanded us all to forgive
those people, but never to trust them; for they
had been most false to him, and to those that
gave them power, and he feared also to their
own souls; And desired me not to grieve for
him, for he should die a Martyr, and that he
doubted not but the Lord would settle his
Throne upon his Son, and that we should be
all happier, then we could have expected to
have been, if he had lived: With many other
things, which at present I cannot remember.</p>

<i>His Majesties Reasons against the pretended

which he intended to deliver in writing on

</p>

<p class="ind"><b>Faithfully transcribed out of the originall Copie under
the Kings own hand.</b></p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">H</span>
<b>Aving</b> already made my protestations not
only against the illegality of this pretended
Court, but also that no earthly power
can justly call me (who am your King) in question
as a Delinquent, <i>I</i> would not any more
open my mouth upon this occasion, more then
to refer my selfe to what I have spoken, were
I alone in this case concerned. But the duty I
owe to God in the preservation of the true Liberty
of my People, will not suffer me at this
time to be silent: For, how can any free-born
Subject of England call life or any thing he
possesseth his own, if power without right daily
make new, and abrogate the old fundamentall
Law of the Land, which I now take to
be the present case. Wherefore when I came
hither, I expected that you would have indeavoured
to have satisfied me concerning these
grounds, which hinder me to Answer to your
pretended Impeachment, but since I see that
nothing I can say will move you to it (though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[page 285]</span>
Negatives are not so naturally proved as Affirmatives)
yet I will shew you the Reason why
I am confident you cannot judge me, nor indeed
the meanest man in England; for I will
not (like you) without shewing a reason, seek
to impose a belief upon My Subjects.</p>

<p class="side">Hereabout I was
stopt, and not suffered
to speake any
more concerning
Reasons.</p>

<p>There is no proceeding just against any man,
but what is warranted either
by Gods Laws, or the municipall
Lawes of the Country
where he lives. Now I am most
confident, that this daies proceeding
cannot be warranted by Gods Law,
for on the contrary the authority of obedience
unto Kings is cleerly warranted and
strictly commanded both in the Old and New
Testament; which if denied, I am ready to
prove: and for the question now in hand,
there it is said, That <i><b>where the word of a King
is, there is Power, and who may say unto him,
what doest thou</b></i>? <i><b>Eccles.</b></i> 8. 4. Then for the
Lawes of this land, I am no lesse confident, that
no learned Lawyer will affirme that an impeachment
can lie against the King, they all
going in his name; and one of their Maximes
is, <i><b>that the King can do no wrong</b></i>. Besides, the
law upon which you ground your proceedings,
must either be old or new; if old shew
it; if new, tell what authority warranted by
the fundamentall Laws of the land hath made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[page 286]</span>
it, and when. But how the House of Commons
can erect a Court of Judicature, which
was never one it self (as is well known to all
Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to
judge; And it were full as strange that they
should pretend to make Laws without King
or Lords-House, to any that have heard speak
of the Lawes of England.</p>

<p>And admitting, but not granting, that the
people of Englands Commission could grant
your pretended Power, I see nothing you can
shew for that; for certainly you never asked
the question of the tenth man of the Kingdom,
and in this way you manifestly wrong even the
poorest Plough-man, if you demand not his
free consent; nor can you pretend any colour
for this your pretended Commission without
the consent at least of the major part of every
man in England, of whatsoever quality or condition,
which I am sure, you never went about
to seek; so far are you from having
it. Thus you see that I speak not for my own
right alone, as I am your King, but also for the
true Liberty of all my Subjects, which consists
not in sharing the power of Government, but
in living under such Laws, such a Government
as may give themselves the best assurance of
their lives and propriety of their goods. Nor
in this must or do I forget the priviledges of
both Houses of Parliament, which this dayes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[page 287]</span>
proceedings doth not only violate, but likewise
occasion the greatest breach of their Publike
Faith that (I beleeve) ever was heard of, with
which I am far from charging the two houses:
for all the pretended crimes laid against me,
bear date long before this late Treaty at Newport,
in which I having concluded as much as
in me lay, and hopefully expecting the two
Houses agreement thereunto, I was suddenly
surprized, and hurried from thence as a Prisoner,
upon which accompt I am against my will
brought hither, where since I am come, I cannot
but to my power defend the ancient Laws
and Liberties of this Kingdom, together with
my own just Right; then for any thing I can
see the higher house is totally excluded.</p>

<p>And for the House of Commons, it is too
well known that the major part of them are
detained or deterr'd from sitting, so as if I had
no other, this were sufficient for me to protest
against the lawfulnesse of your pretended
Court. Besides all this, the peace of the Kingdom
is not the least in my thoughts; and what
hopes of settlement is there so long as power
raignes without rule of Law, changing the
whole frame of that government under which
this Kingdom hath flourished for many hundred
years, (nor will I say what will fall out in
case this lawlesse unjust proceeding against me
do go on) &amp; beleeve it the Commons of England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[page 288]</span>
will not thanke you for this change, for
they will remember how happy they have been
of late years under the raign of Q. <i><b>Elizabeth</b></i>,
the King my Father and my self, untill the beginning
of these unhappy troubles, and wil have
cause to doubt that they shall never be so happy
under any new. And by this time it will be too
sensibly evident, that the Armes I took up were
only to defend the fundamentall Laws of this
Kingdom, against those who have supposed my
power hath totally changed the ancient Government.</p>

<p>Thus having shewed you briefly the Reasons,
why I cannot submit to your pretended authority
without violating the trust which I have
from God, for the welfare and liberty of my
people; I expect from you either clear Reasons
to convince my Judgment, shewing me
that I am in an error (and then truly I will readily
answer) or that you will withdraw your
proceedings.</p>
